I'm currently using gPodder + Panucci[1] on my N800. This way, I can
download podcasts wherever I am currently (only WiFi is needed), and I
can also listen to my podcasts and playback automatically resumes where
I last stopped it when I didn't finish one episode.

For using a filesystem-based MP3 player, the best way would probably to
output and maintain a M3U file in the destination folder on the MP3
player. For this, we need to know if the MP3 player supports things like
relative paths and if it support both &quot;/&quot; and &quot;\&quot; or just one of them.

&gt;<i> I think there could be a problem with different implementation for
</I>&gt;<i> playlist support on different devices. The IAudio X5 could read
</I>&gt;<i> playlists with full path (including my mountpoint) and &quot;/&quot;. But for
</I>&gt;<i> the Meizu M6 you have to use &quot;\&quot; in your path information. And the
</I>&gt;<i> Meizu M6 don't support full path information in the playlists. So I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't copy&amp;paste this information on linux because I have to modify
</I>&gt;<i> all &quot;/&quot; to &quot;\&quot; with the texteditor.
</I>&gt;<i> Could a playlist support in gPodder be usefull for other people too?
</I>
You could file a feature request on bugs.gpodder.org. If you tell me how
M3Us should have their path set on the MP3 player (relative, absolute,
with / or \), it should not be too difficult to implement something like
that for Filesystem-based MP3 players.
