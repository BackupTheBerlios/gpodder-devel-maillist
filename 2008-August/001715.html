&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> Well, I use Rockbox on an iPod. I have a directory named 'podcasts'. I have set up to sync the podcasts, using individual subdirectories per channel, so I get
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /podcasts/channel_1
</I>&gt;<i> /podcasts/channel_2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> etc. I don't make a playlist, I just select an episode I want to listen to, and press 'play'. The only slightly irritating feature of rockbox is that it will not keep track of which episodes have been played and which have not yet been played (*). It is my habit to simply delete the episode as soon as it is finished.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*) I know that rockbox is supposed to have a 'last.fm log', but I never got that to work. I can select the feature, the player says to reset it, but after the reset nothing else seems to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>

So there's no .scrobbler.log in your player's root directory? Or is it
a problem with gPodder?

To answer Bernd's question, for the time being I listen to the
majority of my podcasts at my PC and when I'm about to go somewhere I
transfer an episode or two to my n810 via the bluetooth sync feature.

When I do happen to use my rockbox player I also use subdirectories
for each channel like Wilfred, but I use rockbox's bookmarking feature
to keep track of what I've listened to and where I am in the file.
