<PRE>Hello,

I am using a filebased player to listen to my podcasts. At the moment I use
the Meizu M6 (<A HREF="http://en.meizu.com/product_m6.asp">http://en.meizu.com/product_m6.asp</A>). Before it I used the
Cowon IAudio X5.
It's no problem to synchronize my podcasts with gPodder to my devices. But
it's very painfull to organize my playlists.

At the moment I use the following workflow:
- plug in my device
- synchronize the podcasts
- open the playlist with a texteditor
- open the podcast directory on my device to recognize the correct path and
filename
- manually write/modify the playlist to organize the episodes in the order I
like to listen to it

What's your workflow for listening to podcasts? What do you think about a
build in solution in gPodder to manage playlists for devices? I think there
could be a problem with different implementation for playlist support on
different devices. The IAudio X5 could read playlists with full path
(including my mountpoint) and &quot;/&quot;. But for the Meizu M6 you have to use &quot;\&quot;
in your path information. And the Meizu M6 don't support full path
information in the playlists. So I couldn't copy&amp;paste this information on
linux because I have to modify all &quot;/&quot; to &quot;\&quot; with the texteditor.
Could a playlist support in gPodder be usefull for other people too?


Regards
  Bernd Schlapsi
