<PRE>Thanks for your feedback. See below..

&gt;<i> I've spent many hours chasing bugs on 0.14.0 &quot;A Short Drink From
</I>&gt;<i> a Certain Fountain&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's my list of bugs found. I want to hear out what you think
</I>&gt;<i> of them before reporting on the bug tracker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - When you go to iPod -&gt; &quot;Remove episodes from device&quot;, the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Copying files to device window&quot; shows up in addition to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Delete episodes chooser window&quot;. Screenshot will be posted if
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>&gt;<i> Correct behavior would be for the &quot;Copying files to device window&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> not to show up.
</I>
Please file this in the bug tracker. It's an UI bug.

&gt;<i> 2 - Tooltips not showing up on the episode list. When you hover
</I>&gt;<i> over an episode, a tooltip used to show up with shownotes for the
</I>&gt;<i> specific episode.
</I>&gt;<i> Solution: Right click on episode and select &quot;episode details&quot; option.
</I>
This change is deliberate. You can over over the icon of the episode
or podcast to see the tooltip.

&gt;<i> 3 - On some podcasts, &quot;Buzz Out Loud&quot; for example, when right
</I>&gt;<i> clicking on episode and selecting episode details option, gpodder
</I>&gt;<i> freezes for several seconds before showing details.
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that in most podcasts this doesn't happen.
</I>
This is because you are probably using the HTML shownotes and the
podcast in question uses embedded images? This has been fixed in
the development version already, as that will have a threaded
downloader for the shownotes that should not freeze.

&gt;<i> 4 - When gpodder is killed by accident instead of gracefuly
</I>&gt;<i> closed. Podcast list is corrupted and all episodes downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> before killing it don't show on gpodder's list even though they
</I>&gt;<i> take up hard drive space.
</I>&gt;<i> Quick solution: Delete all folders on the gpodder download
</I>&gt;<i> folder then re-download your episodes.
</I>&gt;<i> This can probably be avoided by having gpodder save it's database
</I>&gt;<i> after downloads are finished.
</I>
Yep, please file a bug about this in the bug tracker. We do not
store the database changes during runtime now to have a better
UI performance on low-end devices. We should save the database
every now and then, though.

&gt;<i> I really liked the new features added to gpodder.
</I>&gt;<i> My favorite was my.gpodder.org
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
Thanks for taking the time to review it and prepare this list 
of potential bugs.

Thomas
