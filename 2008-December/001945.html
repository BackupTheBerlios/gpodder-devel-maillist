<PRE>I've spent many hours chasing bugs on 0.14.0 &quot;A Short Drink From
a Certain Fountain&quot;.

Here's my list of bugs found. I want to hear out what you think
of them before reporting on the bug tracker.

1 - When you go to iPod -&gt; &quot;Remove episodes from device&quot;, the
&quot;Copying files to device window&quot; shows up in addition to the
&quot;Delete episodes chooser window&quot;. Screenshot will be posted if
needed.
Correct behavior would be for the &quot;Copying files to device window&quot;
not to show up.

2 - Tooltips not showing up on the episode list. When you hover
over an episode, a tooltip used to show up with shownotes for the
specific episode.
Solution: Right click on episode and select &quot;episode details&quot; option.

3 - On some podcasts, &quot;Buzz Out Loud&quot; for example, when right
clicking on episode and selecting episode details option, gpodder
freezes for several seconds before showing details.
Please note that in most podcasts this doesn't happen.

4 - When gpodder is killed by accident instead of gracefuly
closed. Podcast list is corrupted and all episodes downloaded
before killing it don't show on gpodder's list even though they
take up hard drive space.
Quick solution: Delete all folders on the gpodder download
folder then re-download your episodes.
This can probably be avoided by having gpodder save it's database
after downloads are finished.

I really liked the new features added to gpodder.
My favorite was my.gpodder.org

Best regards,
Silvio Sisto
