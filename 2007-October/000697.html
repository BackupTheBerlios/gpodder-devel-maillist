<PRE>I use mythTV to record TV programs and have scripts set up to
re-encode them to iPod-size and create a podcast xml file for them.
Problem is, I can't find a decent way to get them onto the iPod
without using iTunes.

I'm hoping gpodder can do what I need:
- Connect to a podcast and get the list of episodes
- &quot;Download&quot; them directly to the device

Since I am recording all these programs on my PC, there is no need to
&quot;download&quot; them before syncing to the iPod. I can either have the xml
file refer to the files by their local filename or by a URL to the
local apache server, either of which will be able to retrieve the
files fast enough to copy directly to the device. What I don't want to
do is have it &quot;download&quot; all the episodes to a new location before
syncing them, as this is a bit of a waste of space having 2 copies of
all the recordings.

So I guess the question is - is this possible with gpodder?

Some ideas for how it might work:
- set the download directory to be the same as the directory that the
videos are already stored in. At the moment that seems to really
confuse gpodder, as everything it tries to download is already there.
- set a per-podcast &quot;download directly&quot; flag

Any other ideas? I'd really like to get this working. I tried using
Amarok, but Amarok is VERY slow at syncing video podcasts and I've had
zero luck with identifying the reason. Thanks!

 - Jeff
