<PRE>Hi all,

I know it's off-topic, and will stop asking if I'm not
allowed. 

I have a question: I have a 30 GB iPod running
Rockbox. The problem is: it's full and I want a larger
capacity player (my wife tells me to be more
'selective' but the point of such a player is that I
don't have to be selective :-))  ). I have Linux PCs
only and I *refuse* to use anything labeled
'Microsoft'. Thus, players that transfer files via
proprietary (Windows-based) software are out of the
question. Thus, a file-system based player is
preferable.

The newest Apple players cannot be converted to
Rockbox (yet). The players that are 'Rockbox-able' are
all somewhat older models. I would welcome tips and
advice on file-system based players, all shapes and
sizes (Zune is out of the question of course - Toshiba
players are on the edge because they use Windows).

See you,
Wilfred
