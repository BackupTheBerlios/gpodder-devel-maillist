<PRE>Thomas,
I understand what you mean.. I didn't intend to be ungrateful for your work
- after all we are not paying anything for this.. :) This was only an advice
and a request at the same time.. If it's possible, very well.. if not, we'll
live with it.

However, before gPodder I was using Podnova. I think they developed their
code in python too. With Podnova I was able to see the podcasts saved as
human-readable folders. You could take a look at their code and see how they
solved this problem. It's open source and hosted by sourceforge ..

Again, thank you for your work in gPodder !

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to describe the problem you mention a bit further...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, it's hard to create human-readable names because of the
</I>&gt;<i> nature of RSS feeds. It's like with HTML - if browsers were going to
</I>&gt;<i> reject non-standard HTML, all documents on the web would adhere to the
</I>&gt;<i> standards, but thanks to such &quot;useful&quot; features as quirks mode, browsers
</I>&gt;<i> try to fix the shortcomings of bad markup in the parser code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the problems with RSS feeds doesn't lie in bad markup. Most of the
</I>&gt;<i> time, fields are not set (no &lt;title&gt; element in &lt;item&gt;), fields have
</I>&gt;<i> empty value (&lt;title&gt; exists, but is empty) or very stupid usage of
</I>&gt;<i> fields (just recently, we had a feed where &lt;title&gt; contained a
</I>&gt;<i> description of the episode, a very long string).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two options here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) reject any feeds that have no title, have a too long title or have
</I>&gt;<i>     some other weird properties that are not usual RSS practice
</I>&gt;<i> b) accept all feeds and try to make the best of &quot;what we have&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder tries to to the &quot;b)&quot; route and so we have to be prepared to
</I>&gt;<i> accept feeds without &lt;title&gt;. As you can read from the november 2006
</I>&gt;<i> post above (I think one of the inital thoughts about hashed filenames),
</I>&gt;<i> hashing feed and episode URLs always gives us strings that have some
</I>&gt;<i> sane and stable properties:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) (high probability of) uniqueness
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) sane length (even fixed, but at least not empty or too long)
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) sane alphabet (hexadecimal, i.e. only the characters 0-9 and a-f)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, for every given URL (and _every_ feed has an URL), we have a sane
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ID&quot; that we can use to identify that feed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When depending on human-readable strings (i.e. title, etc..) we run into
</I>&gt;<i> several problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i.) what is the directory name of feeds with &quot;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&quot;??
</I>&gt;<i> ii.) what is the directory name of feed A with title &quot;radio x podcast&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       when there already is a feed B with title &quot;radio x podcast&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> iii.) what is the directory name of a feed with a loooong title?
</I>&gt;<i> iv.) what is the directory name of a feed with chinese characters as
</I>&gt;<i>       title (from the top of my head, imagine (e.g. &quot;&#12454;&#12455;&#12502;&quot;) when
</I>&gt;<i>       using FAT32 as file system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We might be able to create a unique filename for a podcast episode from
</I>&gt;<i> the basename of its url, but is there always an unique basename of the
</I>&gt;<i> podcast feed? It might be &quot;index.xml&quot; or &quot;podcast.rss&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I never understand why some programs add a layer of complexity which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; removes the user one step from their files. I believe programs should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be as transparent as possible to allow people to do what they like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the data produced by that program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder is transparent in that the user doesn't have to care about the
</I>&gt;<i> directory layout, as the user can use the gPodder GUI to browse and
</I>&gt;<i> listen to feeds - all feed information is displayed in the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can always determine feed and episode info for given hashes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; Hash (md5) the URLs in ~/.config/gpodder/channels.opml
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; MD5 of URL = directory name of feed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; Open the file &quot;index.xml&quot; in the feed download directory
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; Hash (md5) the URLs in that file
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; MD5 of URL + extension of basename of URL = filename of episode
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In pseuco-code, this is something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> opml_file = $HOME + '/.config/gpodder/channels.opml'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( ... feed_url is to be obtained from opml_file ... )
</I>&gt;<i> feed_directory = gpodder_download_dir + '/' + md5sum( feed_url )
</I>&gt;<i> feed_index = feed_directory + '/index.xml'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( ... episode_url is to be obtained from feed_index ... )
</I>&gt;<i> extension = file_extension_of( basename( episode_url ) )
</I>&gt;<i> episode_name = feed_directory + '/' + md5sum ( episode_url ) + extension
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Using the non-human readable directory and filenames stops users from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accessing their files except through one program (gpodder) which is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shame.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can use the above method to find more information (metadata) for the
</I>&gt;<i> files than you can with human readable directories, including the title
</I>&gt;<i> and description of episodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've looked through the source code but cannot find where the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory names are set. I'm an okay programmer so could do this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; myself if someone could point me in the right direction. I'd do it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just my local copy if this wasn't something anyone else would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please, by all means try to do it. If it works for all RSS feeds, I
</I>&gt;<i> would be very happy to merge it into gPodder, as it would be the better
</I>&gt;<i> solution than what we have now. But because of the reasons I mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> above, I am very skeptic if this is possible at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The directory name for channels is determined by the &quot;get_filename&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> function of the class &quot;podcastChannel&quot; in &quot;src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> The attributes that _should_ be available when this function is called
</I>&gt;<i> are &quot;url&quot;, &quot;title&quot; and &quot;description&quot; (i.e. &quot;self.title&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The filename for an episode is determined by the &quot;local_filename&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> function of the class &quot;podcastItem&quot; in &quot;src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Only the &quot;url&quot; attribute is guranteed to be available, for all other
</I>&gt;<i> properties, the best possible value is extracted from the RSS feed, but
</I>&gt;<i> you can expect the &quot;title&quot; value to be somewhat identifying, but not
</I>&gt;<i> unique. You also have to be aware that the &quot;title&quot; value _could_ be very
</I>&gt;<i> long (think of a description field value that has been misplaced).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I realise there may be some other reason why the names are non-human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; readable so if I've missed it then please could someone let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from the practical reasons I mentioned above, there is no real
</I>&gt;<i> reason why the hashes are chosen. It was a simple and straightforward
</I>&gt;<i> solution to a problem for which we have not yet found a better solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be quite cool if you could come up with something friendlier :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want, please send the modifications you make to make gPodder's
</I>&gt;<i> directory structure human-readable. It will be a nice-to-have patch for
</I>&gt;<i> interested people :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks and Good Luck!
