The idea sounds nice, but I think this would make the GUI look a bit
more busy, especially when having only a few subscriptions (i.e. trying
to cramp the feeds in &quot;folders&quot; where it doesn't really make sense).

Of couse, having folders for situations where there are 40+
subscriptions might be an option. How many users are here on this list
that have 40+ subscriptions and would like to have a folder-based
channel list?
