First, make sure you have the latest libraries and use &quot;official&quot;
versions of these libraries (i.e. directly from the Fedora repositories,
if possible).

Then, try to re-initialize your iPod's FS, as you described above. You
can always revert your ipod by tarring up its directory structure, or
even make a copy of the partition (the iPodLinux website has some ideas
on backing up an iPod, although it's more targetet towards backing up
the Apple OS partition, but the methods work for the &quot;data&quot; partition as
well).

After you have &quot;wiped&quot; your iPod, initialize it with gtkpod (you'll find
the necessary command in the menu) and then try to use it with gPodder
without ever touching iTunes.

Tell me if this works for you or if the problem still persists.

Thomas
