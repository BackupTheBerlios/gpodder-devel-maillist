<PRE>Hello,

I was wondering why gpodder stores the downloads in crazily named 
directories? I realise that it is partly to ensure unique directories so 
there are no clashes but it means that it is impossible to browse 
through the podcast files manually. I know I can sync to a filesystem so 
I do this for my mp3 player but I also normally use a soft link to the 
podcast downloads directory for my mythtv installation as well. 
Currently I'm changing the device directory and syncing to my mp3 player 
and changing the device directory again to a separate directory for 
mythtv. If the directory names were human readable then it would save me 
a lot of hassle.

I never understand why some programs add a layer of complexity which 
removes the user one step from their files. I believe programs should be 
as transparent as possible to allow people to do what they like with the 
data produced by that program. Using the non-human readable directory 
and filenames stops users from accessing their files except through one 
program (gpodder) which is a shame. I've looked through the source code 
but cannot find where the directory names are set. I'm an okay 
programmer so could do this myself if someone could point me in the 
right direction. I'd do it to just my local copy if this wasn't 
something anyone else would be interested in.

I realise there may be some other reason why the names are non-human 
readable so if I've missed it then please could someone let me know.

Jay
