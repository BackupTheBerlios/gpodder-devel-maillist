<PRE>Hello!

I'll begin by thanking Tom (and any other contributors) for adding the queue
support to gPodder. It makes downloading podcasts at home much more
enjoyable!

Now for some more wishlist items for you to ponder...

- Please could the timeout on updating the feed cache be reduced? I
currently have 27 feeds in gPodder and if one of the RSS feeds is down for
whatever reason, it takes a long, long time before it continues to check the
other feeds. I think a timeout of 10 seconds is reasonable.
- Is it possible to sort the Channel list by alphabetical order, or to add
this as a preference? An 'All Channels' and 'Unplayed Channels' would also
be useful, showing all podcasts and all unplayed podcasts respectively.
- Could you add an option for filesystem MP3 player synchronisation to not
use folders, my device doesn't support folders so I have to copy the files
back out?
- I listen to 99% of my podcasts on my MP3 player and vary rarely from
inside gPodder so it would be very useful if you could add an option to
automatically mark all synchronised podcasts as played. Currently I need to
synchronise and then go through each episode and mark it as played.
- Add that patch to reduce the polling of the download queue view, on my
dual opteron box gPodder hangs the system when updating a large number of
episodes over our 2Gb Internet link.

Absolutely love gPodder BTW - it's come leaps and bounds since the earlier
releases. I much much prefer the new split channel/episode view. Keep up the
good work!
