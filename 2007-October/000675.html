Hello Wilfred,

I have two players that I use on a daily basis that work as filesystem based 
players. The first is my 5.5G, 80GB iPod running rockbox and the second is my 
archos 604wifi which actually runs linux, sadly you can't modify it because 
of a tivo-like lock on the firmware :(

In my experience players that use an mtp interface are also relatively well 
supported(1) under linux and you can use them as a filesystem based player 
using mtpfs(2) (a fuse filesystem that uses libmtp).

I've also heard that players made by Cowon are also good. Infact they actually 
say that their devices are supported under linux on their website.

Happy shopping,

nick
