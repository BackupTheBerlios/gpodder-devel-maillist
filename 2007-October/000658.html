The played/unplayed status is kind of a &quot;listening TODO list&quot; inside
gPodder and (when syncing to an iPod) on the iPod too (iPods put a
bullet in front of unplayed episodes when a special flag in the iTunesDB
is set).

There is an option that you can use to only sync unplayed episodes to
your device, but by default, gPodder will sync all episodes.

Episodes should never be copied repeatedly, because gPodder will check
if the episode exists on the player and skip it if it does:

 - On iPods, it will check if there is an episode from the same
   podcast with the same title in the &quot;Podcasts&quot; playlist
 - On FS-based MP3 players, it will check if the file that is to
   be copied already exists on the MP3 player (same name=same file)

This usually works fine - at least, I haven't heard anyone complain
about that. And the few complaints that came up were about the naming,
which can be changed (since gPodder 0.10.0) in the preferences.

Thomas
