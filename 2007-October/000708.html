<PRE>Hello!

I've just released gPodder 0.10.1, the October 2007 release of gPodder.
Thanks to all who were involved in getting gPodder to where it is today,
below you will find the news announcement, the changelog summary and the
list of people who directly contributed to the changes in this release,
I hope I didn't forget anybody :)

For the next release cycle, I hope that we will be able to fix some
long-standing feature requests and wishlist bugs. I've looked at our
current TODO list and picked out some items that would be nice to have
and could probably be fit into the ~ 1 month release cycle:

 * Parallel/faster feed updates
   (or even asynchronous/backgrounded updates?)
 * System tray icon / libnotify integration
 * Make iPod sync / FS-based sync two-way (delete on iPod)

It would be nice if some volunteers could come up and help implementing
at least parts of these features, of course I can provide help as time
permits and will try to devote some free time to gPodder again.

Anyway, Berlios' FTP server seems to be down at the moment, so I cannot
upload the tarball to the usual location. Until this is fixed, you can
download the tarball here:

<A HREF="http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/gpodder-0.10.1.tar.gz">http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/gpodder-0.10.1.tar.gz</A>

After this has been fixed, gPodder 0.10.1 will be available from:

<A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/gpodder/gpodder-0.10.1.tar.gz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/gpodder/gpodder-0.10.1.tar.gz</A>

Thanks for your time and I hope you'll enjoy this release :)

Thomas

------------------------------------------------------------------

A bit more than a month since our last release, we're proud to announce
gPodder 0.10.1. This release focuses on minor bug fixes and some
usability improvements. For users that download many episodes at once
(and maybe even in parallel), gPodder will not update the GUI so often,
resulting in less CPU usage. Owners of newer iPods with video support
can now synchronize their video podcasts with the &quot;Video Podcasts&quot; menu
item on their iPod (previously, gPodder synchronized videos to the
&quot;Videos&quot; menu).

Grab your copy of gPodder 0.10.1 now or wait until packages appear in
your distribution in the next days or weeks. If you like gPodder and
want to show your appreciation, please have a look at my wishlist or
look at the donations page. The gPodder 0.10.1 tarball is available from
the downloads page.


Features
      * Downloading is less CPU intensive now (GUI update rate limiting)
      * The &quot;Transfer&quot; dialog hides the unnecessary second progressbar
        now (screenshot)
      * iPod: Video podcasts are now synchronized to the &quot;Video
        Podcasts&quot; menu
      * Support for &quot;<A HREF="https://">https://</A>&quot; URLs for episodes
      * Episode list: New &quot;Save episode to folder&quot; menu item
      * Episode list: Update icons after synchronization (when &quot;played&quot;
        status changes)
Code changes
      * Code removal: Symlinking code, unneeded imports
      * Unified code for copying files (GladeWidget.show_copy_dialog)
Bugfixes
      * Channel list selection/update bugfixes
      * Compatibility updates for Win32 (experimental support)
      * Really load channel metadata (custom title and HTTP
        authentication data)
Thanks
      * Wilfred van Rooijen: Excessive CPU usage bug (bug report and
        testing)
      * Nicolas Quienot: Patch to sync videos to the &quot;Video Podcasts&quot;
        menu (iPod)
      * Aravind Seshadri: Bug report (&quot;<A HREF="https://">https://</A>&quot; scheme support)
      * Nick (nikosapi): Patches: Channel list selection; channel
        metadata loading
