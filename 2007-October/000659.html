Open up a terminal, and temporarily set the language to English:

export LC_ALL=C
export LANG=C

Then, start gPodder with the following command:

  gpodder --verbose

Try to reproduce the problem and copy the output from your terminal into
this mail, maybe this gives some hints on why it doesn't work.

Have you initialized your iPod with gtkpod? Does it work with gtkpod?
What about write permissions? Maybe it's a HFS+ iPod that you can _read_
from in AmaroK, but not write.
