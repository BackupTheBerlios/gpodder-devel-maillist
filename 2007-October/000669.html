<PRE>Currently I've got 40+ feeds and being able to categorise and/or 
condense those would be a big help in managing what's going on with all 
those feeds.

I was thinking of something similar to what Liferea does with its feeds 
(see screenshot: <A HREF="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/screenshot9.png">http://liferea.sourceforge.net/screenshot9.png</A> ). Not 
the Unread/Important virtual folders at the bottom (although that would 
be good to have :) - just the ability to group feeds into categories is 
what  I'm really after)

Like gPodder, Liferea stores its channels in an OPML file however they 
use a couple of additional attributes which allows them to save out the 
folder structure as well. Likewise, Google Reader can export feeds w/ 
folder structure as an OPML file however they don't use the attributes 
that Liferea does. Is there a standard for this?

I'm not sure how big of a request this is since I've never programmed in 
Python and am unfamiliar with pyGTK. :/
Does anyone else think this would be useful?
