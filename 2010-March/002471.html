<PRE>I like all this ideas.

I'm using the playlist feature and I think I have a rough idea how to  
implement this.
If there is a list of devices below the channels this list could be in  
an hierarchical view. And so it could be possible to create one or  
more list per device. Similar as all the music players handle this  
kind of feature.

So the device list should be look something like:
+ DEVICE1
   - Playlist1
   - Playlist2
+ DEVICE2
   - Playlist1

Selecting a device in this list should display it's tracks in the main  
window. If the users selects a playlist (e.g Playlist1 of DEVICE1) the  
tracks of this playlist should be displayed in the main window. With  
the option to order the tracks.

Would do you think?

Regards
  Bernd


Quoting jerome chabod &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpodder-devel">jerome.chabod at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> I like Justin's idea of having a list of devices below the channels.
</I>&gt;<i> * the list should only be visible if at least one device was added.
</I>&gt;<i> * You could just add a new device in the list from a menu item, determining
</I>&gt;<i> it's type and preferences (like adding a new feed). Alternatively, we could
</I>&gt;<i> reuse Justin's attempt to use GVFS (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332</A>) to guess which device is here.
</I>&gt;<i> * A context menu on a device in the list would permit to change its
</I>&gt;<i> preferences, have information (free space, battery level if
</I>&gt;<i> available...),remove or disconnect it, just like we do with channels.
</I>&gt;<i> * Selecting a device in the list should try to connect it (if not already)
</I>&gt;<i> and display it's tracks in the main windows (where episodes are displyed
</I>&gt;<i> now) with the possibility to delete episodes (just like the episode selector
</I>&gt;<i> does for the moment when selecting &quot;remove episodes from the device&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> * Ideally, one could drag and drop episodes to a given device in the list to
</I>&gt;<i> transfer it.
</I>&gt;<i> * When transfering an episode or synchronising, gpodder should ask for which
</I>&gt;<i> device to use if more than one. Alternativly, a user could flag a device as
</I>&gt;<i> current (it could for exemple appear bold in the list).
</I>&gt;<i> * I'm lacking of inspiration for playlist handling since I don't use this
</I>&gt;<i> feature ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Give me your ideas, and if nobody is already working on it, I could try to
</I>&gt;<i> implements a quick mock-up. I'm relatively familiar with gpodder devices and
</I>&gt;<i> sync module in gpodder. On another hand, I haven't got so many free time for
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder and it could take monthes, so help is welcome. Give me you feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> J&#233;r&#244;me
</I>&gt;<i>
