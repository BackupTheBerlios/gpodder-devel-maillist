<PRE>I like Justin's idea of having a list of devices below the channels.
* the list should only be visible if at least one device was added.
* You could just add a new device in the list from a menu item, determining
it's type and preferences (like adding a new feed). Alternatively, we could
reuse Justin's attempt to use GVFS (see
<A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332</A>) to guess which device is here.
* A context menu on a device in the list would permit to change its
preferences, have information (free space, battery level if
available...),remove or disconnect it, just like we do with channels.
* Selecting a device in the list should try to connect it (if not already)
and display it's tracks in the main windows (where episodes are displyed
now) with the possibility to delete episodes (just like the episode selector
does for the moment when selecting &quot;remove episodes from the device&quot;).
* Ideally, one could drag and drop episodes to a given device in the list to
transfer it.
* When transfering an episode or synchronising, gpodder should ask for which
device to use if more than one. Alternativly, a user could flag a device as
current (it could for exemple appear bold in the list).
* I'm lacking of inspiration for playlist handling since I don't use this
feature ;-)

Give me your ideas, and if nobody is already working on it, I could try to
implements a quick mock-up. I'm relatively familiar with gpodder devices and
sync module in gpodder. On another hand, I haven't got so many free time for
gPodder and it could take monthes, so help is welcome. Give me you feedback.
Regards
J&#233;r&#244;me
