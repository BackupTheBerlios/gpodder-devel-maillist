<PRE>First, the new config UI looks much better to me. Cleaner and smaller,
fits the EEE PC 701 screen.

Second, the config UI was a serious problem when I last looked at the
GVFS integration. It was so because when a device is connected, I had
to change some config options and restore them when the device was
disconnected. If more than one device was connected simultaneously, it
was even more complex.

I think the best way would be to start with adding support for
multiple devices, as Hilton suggested. As I see it, there would be a
list of connected devices (e.g., below the list of channels), each
device type would have its own management module (e.g., ipod, mtp and
fs). These modules would store and manage device settings on their own
(if the device has any). gPodder would define a generic Device object,
with methods to send files and eject the device, and the drivers would
send new such objects to gPodder when new devices are connected.

There should be more device drivers for those who wish to sync over
samba, sftp or whatever comes to mind.

&gt;<i> Hello there!

</I>&gt;<i> We're somewhere in the middle of the gPodder 2.4 release cycle, and one
</I>&gt;<i> of the blockers for this release is the lack of a config UI for portable
</I>&gt;<i> device synchronization (FS-based, iPod and MTP). The old UI was removed,
</I>&gt;<i> because the preferences dialog has been re-written (I like the new one
</I>&gt;<i> much better if I may say so myself ;).

</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I have not used this feature for a long time, as I've been

</I>&gt;<i> two problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;a) It's not an itch I need to scratch and
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;b) others might have better ideas how this feature should work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, who wants to write a little &quot;portable device config&quot; UI for the new
</I>&gt;<i> preferences dialog and send a patch to be included for the next release?
