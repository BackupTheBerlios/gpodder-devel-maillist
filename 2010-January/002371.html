<PRE>Thank you for GPodder I really love the way it works for Podcasting
and transferring to my device, but I miss a few features:

Audio

1. I would like the ability to select which feeds automatically download
when new feeds are available. Would save me the trouble of updating the
feeds and clicking dozens of feeds. Certain shows I want to listen maybe
once a month though they are daily podcast i.e. Buzz Out Loud.

2. Decided which feeds are automatically deleted and which feeds I keep the
feeds. Fro example I like to keep This American Life and Radio Lab podcast
so I can share certain ones with friends and co-workers. Podcast like news
shows I want deleted the second they are transfered to my device.

3. I would like the option for certain feeds to not be transfered to device.


Videos (Miro downloads great and has great feed options, but I have too many
issues in Linux with Miro to stay with it)

1. The option of downloading Videos to a separate directory.

2. The option to not transfer any videos to device.

3. Would be neat to have a conversion tool for videos for device (BUT I know
that is a ton of work).

Just my late Christmas Wishes!

P.S. KPodder would be cool also with some QT love :)
