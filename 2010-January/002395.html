<PRE>Hello!

The my.gpodder.org Uni project is quickly approaching its end, and so
you can expect lots of mygpo-related news this and next week.

Today, I've landed the first big patch for the Advanced API integration
on my.gpodder.org. Right now, you can't really test this, because I had
to apply some fixes to the web service to get things going that are not
yet deployed on the production installation, because we still have to
run the changes through our mini-QA process ;) At the next deployment
(which should happen later this week), the new changes will be merged in
the production installation.

What does this mean in user terms (techies can check out the diff ;):

 * Settings dialog with device configuration (for managing multiple
   gPodder installations on different devices with one user account)
 * Automatic background synchronization when subscription list changes
   (the client will upload changes to the web server and request updates
   from it - with &quot;diff-like&quot; support to save bandwidth)
 * Manage your subscription list away from your computer (e.g. in a
   Internet cafe or at a friend's house) on the website - gPodder will
   automatically present the changes to you the next time you run it and
   will allow you to confirm or reject the changes

Oh, and this change introduces a hard dependency on the &quot;mygpoclient&quot;
library. If you don't want to install the library right now, you can
simply ignore the new commits and check out the Git tag
&quot;gpodder-before-mygpoclient&quot; from the repository. Please be aware that
we are not going to support the non-mygpoclient version anymore due to
practical reasons (it hopefully gets mygpoclient packaged up more
quickly ;).

In related news, mygpoclient has been packed for Debian and is currently
waiting in Debian's NEW queue for checking:

<A HREF="http://ftp-master.debian.org/new/mygpoclient_1.0-1.html">http://ftp-master.debian.org/new/mygpoclient_1.0-1.html</A>

Please note that gPodder will always work WITHOUT a my.gpodder.org
account, although we'd be happy to hear from you why you don't want to
use the web service in case you decide not to use it :) As long as you
don't set the &quot;mygpo_enabled&quot; configuration option to &quot;True&quot;, gPodder
will not communicate with my.gpodder.org. And if you want to set up your
own mygpo installation, simply set the &quot;mygpo_server&quot; variable to the
hostname of your installation - easy! :)


Enjoy!
Thomas
