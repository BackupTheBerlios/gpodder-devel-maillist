<PRE>Hello,

First I'd like to congratulate and thanks Gpodder developers, this 
podcast application is more than useful and I need it every day !

I just have 2 little problems, one concerning  a bug when transferring 
files to a MTP or another folder of disk, that I reported :
<A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755</A>

The other one is not a bug, nothing really wrong, but a wish that would 
make life easier, that's why I'm asking it here, also because I did not 
find a solution for now.

In Gpodder default view, on the right panel for audio / video podcast 
files, is list with most recent episodes at the top, which is logical (I 
class my emails in the same way, or files in Nautilus also).

The problem is that, when I select and run many audio / video files to 
be opened in Totem directly from Gpodder, files are read in inverse 
chronological order (the most updated first, the latest at the end)

In Nautilus in list mode it is the same thing, but you only have to 
click on the &quot;date&quot; column to invert order so in Totem all is right. In 
Gpodder I did not find how to invert order. So here, when I select many 
files, Totem plays first the most recent instead of the oldest.

In right panel of Totem we can move files one to one, but if you have a 
lot in your reading list, it's annoying.

Other solution is to play files individually, but for podcasts during 
less than 2 minutes, it makes to do the manual run very often. Or it is 
possible to open in Gpodder the Nautilus folder where podcasts are, have 
list with oldest files on top or icon view, select them and run with Totem.

So that is my question, in order to make some &quot;clicks&quot; economy:

Is there, in the advanced options of Gpodder, a parameter to change to 
have in list the oldest files at top, or a way to make Totem reading 
selected files in &quot;inverted order&quot; as usually when running from Gpodder ?

I keep Totem for podcasts and videos, because one of its main features 
is to remember exactly where we stopped reading a file, and begin at the 
same place the next time we run it, it is very useful.

Thanks in advance if someone has a solution.

Best regards,

Xavier
