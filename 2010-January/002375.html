<PRE>Hello, Marc!

There is a bug for this somewhere in Bugzilla, I think.

</I>
There will be some more intelligent deleting (most likely based on the
podcast type) in the future. For now, you can use Ctrl+K.

&gt;<i> 3. I would like the option for certain feeds to not be transfered to device.
</I>
The &quot;Edit Podcast&quot; dialog has a &quot;Skip this podcast when syncing to my
device&quot; checkbox that does exactly that.

&gt;<i> 1. The option of downloading Videos to a separate directory.
</I>
Probably won't be in upstream. It should be easy for you to change that
in the code. See the &quot;gpodder.model&quot; module and the &quot;gpodder.download&quot;
module for ways to insert that.

You could also symlink or hardlink all video files to a separate
directory. You can do these things via a custom script, no need to put
that code into gPodder. Most podcasts are video-only or audio-only,
anyway, and every podcast is put into its own directory, anyway.

&gt;<i> 2. The option to not transfer any videos to device.
</I>
Please open a feature reuqest for this on <A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/.">http://bugs.gpodder.org/.</A> This
sounds like a good idea, and will probably result in a &quot;My device
supports playing back viddeos&quot; checkbox in the preferences dialog.

&gt;<i> 3. Would be neat to have a conversion tool for videos for device (BUT I know
</I>&gt;<i> that is a ton of work).
</I>
Yes, that's out-of-scope for gPodder. However, you can write your own
post-download hook script that can convert videos. Please have a look
at the user manual (&quot;Time stretching&quot; in the advanced topics):

<A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/User_Manual">http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/User_Manual</A>

Also have a look at src/gpodder/libconverter.py

&gt;<i> P.S. KPodder would be cool also with some QT love :)
</I>
If you want, you can write your Qt GUI using PyQT or PySide for gPodder.

The backend code is independent of GTK+, you just have to implement some
model classes (see the &quot;gpodder.gtkui&quot; package for all GTK+-specific
code) and write a replacement &quot;main&quot; GUI class (in gui.py). Oh yeah -
you probably have to split some program logic from gui.py in a
UI-independent class; have not gotten around to do this (yet).


HTH.
