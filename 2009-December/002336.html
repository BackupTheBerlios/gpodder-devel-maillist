<PRE>Hello!

gPodder 2.1 has been released. Download it from <A HREF="http://gpodder.org">http://gpodder.org</A> :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-12-12: gPodder 2.1 &quot;The Luminous Fish Effect&quot; released

Yeah, we've taken our time to bring you this feature release that builds
on top of the solid gPodder 2.0 base, but after nearly three months, we
are back: This is the first release that officially supports Maemo 5 at
the same time as other platforms, as we have integrated all
platform-specific changes into the upstream codebase. You will notice a
few new features, for example the search-as-you-type feature that will
allow you to filter down the podcast and episode list to quickly find
that old episode that you have been looking for.

Thanks to all the developers, supporters and translators who helped to
make this release a great one! We'll continue with the development of
gPodder and the my.gpodder.org integration in the next few weeks, so
that you will have a even more pleasurable podcasting experience in case
you are using more than one device for downloading podcasts.

For a detailed ChangeLog, see gpodder-2.1 shortlog on repo.or.cz.

If you find any problems, report bugs in the bug tracker. The new
version of gPodder is now available on the downloads page, and the
Ubuntu PPA for gPodder will be updated with new package versions
shortly.


Enjoy!
Thomas
