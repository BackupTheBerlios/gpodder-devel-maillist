<PRE>Hi,

I'd like to find a pratical way to handle photo feeds (like the ones from flickr and so on), and gpodder looks quite attractive (with all its features) as a good code &quot;base&quot; for this.

I tried to make it handle photo/image feeds, and it was actually quit easy to get basic support for this. 

So first, thanks to the developpers for *not* making this little hack a nigthmare ;)

The modifications are indeed quite small: 1 added file, and 2 modified lines of codes in model.py. The new and modified files can be found there:

<A HREF="http://tibonihoo.net/fichiers/gpodder/image_feeds_in_gpodder_2.1.tar.gz">http://tibonihoo.net/fichiers/gpodder/image_feeds_in_gpodder_2.1.tar.gz</A>

(if anybody wants to try it, I've included an opml file with the address of 3 image feeds using different feed representation).

I guess having &quot;basic&quot; support may not be enough though and having things like thumbnails appearing in the episode list or the ability to launch a slideshow for a (group of) channel(s) would make sense for image-related feeds.

However before going any further in modifying my copy of gpodder, I wanted to know if the gpodder devs were open to including some support for image feeds or if it's incompatible with the project's aims for instance (I tried to search a little about this in the wiki and the mailing list but could not find anything).

Thanks,

Thibauld
