Wow, that's really, really nice :) I've just played around with it. Is
that targetting the iPad (as I see there are some meta tags suggesting
that it's at least special-cased for these devices)?

For the source, it would probably be good to have a README file with
instructions on how to try it out on one's own machine. Is the source
code to the code in fileserver.jar available somewhere, or is that just
available in binary form?

What I've also noticed is that time is weirdly formatted in the playback
view (i.e. one minute and 4 seconds is displayed as &quot;1:4&quot; instead of
&quot;01:04&quot;).

Right now, this just searches the public podcast directory, right? Are
there plans to integrate this with the login area/user accounts, so that
users logged into gpodder.net can only show their subscriptions and also
update their playback status in gpodder.net when playing episodes in
mPodder.

Anyway, great work so far, looking really forward to see more of your
project there :) Tell us if you need any help with the web service!


Thanks,
Thomas
