<PRE>Hello Dov,

</I>
The &quot;master&quot; branch is where the &quot;stable&quot; development happens. After
every release, the &quot;master&quot; branch is tagged and the tagged commit is
then merged into the &quot;maemo-5&quot; branch. Then, the Debian packaging is
updated in the &quot;maemo-5&quot; branch, and a release is made (and it's also
tagged with &quot;fremantle/...&quot;). So basically, &quot;maemo-5&quot; tracks &quot;master&quot;
and just includes some Maemo-specific changes and the packaging info.

&gt;<i> 2. Should I open a bug report / feature request for this, or is that
</I>&gt;<i> not necessary?
</I>
Yes, please. This helps me queue up tasks and quickly merge/process
bugs, features and patches without having to wade through e-mails :)

&gt;<i> 3. While working on this, I also noticed that the &quot;visit website&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> option seems to have been disabled at some point, attached is another
</I>&gt;<i> patch which re-enables it.
</I>
Please also open a bug report for that and attach the patch.

&gt;<i> This is my first foray into gpodder code, so any comments will be
</I>&gt;<i> greatly appreciated...!
</I>
I'll give some feedback when you've created the bugs and added the
patches - this way, the patch discussion is attached to the patch.

I hope that's not too much red tape for you :)


Thanks :)
Thomas
