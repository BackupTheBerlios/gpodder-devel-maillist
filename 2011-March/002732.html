<PRE>Hi!

The fremantle gui does not currently expose an interface for locking a
channel (i.e., setting it to &quot;Keep episodes&quot; by default). The attached
patch implements such an interface (a menu item in the channel's
episodes view).

A few questions:

1. I'm a little confused about the different branches --- as far as I
can tell, there are two &quot;stable&quot; branches (excluding tres) currently
being maintained: master and maemo-5 -- is that correct? What's the
relation between them? The patch applies cleanly against both of them;
but just so that I get a better understanding of the process: would it
be applied separately to both, or applied to one and then merged into
the other (and if so, in which direction)?

2. Should I open a bug report / feature request for this, or is that
not necessary?

3. While working on this, I also noticed that the &quot;visit website&quot;
option seems to have been disabled at some point, attached is another
patch which re-enables it.


This is my first foray into gpodder code, so any comments will be
greatly appreciated...!

Thanks!
Dov
