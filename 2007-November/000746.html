&gt;<i> I think, gPodder's behaviour should be the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - default to SI prefixes (decimal, 1000 bytes = 1 kB)
</I>&gt;<i> - optional: binary prefixes; &quot;1024 et al.&quot; (and display &quot;KiB, MiB, ...&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any objections?
</I>
Hm, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it. The problem is that the users expect kB as 1024, 
not as 1000.

If they see kB, they expect 1024. I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem if they see 
KiB instead of kB. I think they will know that kB is meant, they just wonder 
what the i does there :D

The problem with SI prefixes is the file becomes &#8220;bigger&#8221;. I guess some people 
would be confused by that.

I would vote for binary prefixes as default and SI as optional. Binary 
prefixes aren&#8217;t wrong. It&#8217;s just that if SI units are used correctly, but the 
user doesn&#8217;t know it, he could wonder why the filesize is different than in 
the file browser.

&gt;<i> That would change the values displayed (without changing the unit's
</I>&gt;<i> name), but as gPodder currently displays &quot;wrong&quot; values, I guess this is
</I>&gt;<i> okay. If people want the current calculation (binary), they can switch
</I>&gt;<i> to it in the config file and have KiB, MiB, etc.. displayed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be the Right Thing(tm) when looking at standards. The changed
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour of gPodder is justified by the fact that currently gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> displays non-standard units/values.
</I>
Just again, binary prefixes are not wrong. What&#8217;s wrong is just if kilo is 
used as 2^10 or mega as 2^20. A kibibyte with 1024 Byte is completely 
correct. I just believe that some people would rather like the correct SI 
units (But I don&#8217;t think that some &#8212;sorry&#8211; unknown apps like gpodder could 
change the way the users use kilo if Microsoft and Apple do not adapt them) 
if they know the difference.

So in summary (in my opinion) the way would be:
default: leave the way it is now, but change KB, MB and so on to KiB, MiB, GiB
optional: offer SI units with kB as 10^3, MB as 10^6 and so on.
