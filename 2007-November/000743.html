<PRE>Hello,

Am Donnerstag 01 November 2007 schrieb Thomas Perl:
&gt;<i> Basically, you want to add support for the decimal output format of file

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;binary&quot;), apart from the added &quot;i&quot; in &quot;MiB&quot;, &quot;KiB&quot; and &quot;GiB&quot;.
</I>
Well, because I think some people would be confused if there is a &#8220;i&#8221; between 
the prefix and the unit. But I don&#8217;t know, personally I like the &#8220;MiB&#8221;  
better than the wrong &#8220;MB&#8221;. I guess, MiB as standard usage would also be ok.

&gt;<i> I've googled a bit for the &quot;BYTEPREFIX&quot; environment variable, and I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't found a project that uses this variable name for the same thing.
</I>
Yes, you&#8217;re right, I&#8217;ve invented it. :D

&gt;<i> For this reason, I am against &quot;inventing&quot; a standard. If there is a
</I>&gt;<i> variable in POSIX or GNU that defines that behaviour, I'd be glad to add
</I>&gt;<i> support for that.
</I>
Well, I thought maybe writing to a GNU mailing list for that (but I don&#8217;t 
really know if they would be open minded for that)... As far as I know, some 
GNU applications already use the binary prefixes, but I find it better if one 
could also use the SI prefixes. That way, the 500 GB hard disk would also be 
displayed as 500 GB in the system. I don&#8217;t really see a point using file 
sizes as powers of 2 with ordinary files.

&gt;<i> We can, however, add this as a configuration option to gpodder.conf and
</I>&gt;<i> not add configuration support for it in the GUI. This way, the UI does
</I>&gt;<i> not get too difficult, and interested users can still set their
</I>&gt;<i> preference in gpodder.conf.
</I>
Well, ok, I guess this would be the best option, then.

&gt;<i> I will have a look as time permits. Here are some questions that I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still not sure about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  -) What IS the standard of displaying file sizes? (KB[2], KB[10], KiB?)
</I>&gt;<i>  -) What is the benefit of providing &quot;decimal&quot; file sizes?
</I>&gt;<i>  -) It would modify the results of our speed/etc.. calculations, is
</I>&gt;<i>     that something we want or should avoid?
</I>
1. As far as I know, there is no real standard. The SI prefixes (which are 
used in natural sciences) define a kilo as 10^3, a mega as 10^6, a giga as 
10^9 and so on. That way, one can easily just cut the last digits of a file 
size and get a correct file size with a prefix (e.g. 194385745 byte = 194,39 
MB) without using a calculator.
Hard disk manufacturers also use them. That way, a 500 GB hdd has really 500 
billion bytes. 
The problem now is that in the past, the kilo, mega and so on prefixes were 
used as 2^10, 2^20, 2^30 etc. But that&#8217;s incorrect, kilo etc. are defined as 
10^3 etc. For this confusion to end, the binary prefixes were invented. That 
way, a kibi is 2^10. 

In short: kB for 1000 Bytes and KiB for 1024 Bytes are correct, but kB for 
1024 Byte is incorrect. 

2. Well, it is the correct usage of the SI prefixes. :D The problem is that 
the hdd manufacturers use the SI prefixes correctly (ok, they do that because 
they can advertise &#8220;more&#8221; space than there really is, but the thing is, they 
are correct whether the customer likes it or not). But almost all software 
products don&#8217;t use them correctly. That&#8217;s also a reason because I thought of 
an &#8220;off&#8221; setting. 
I personally would really like to use the SI prefixes in my applications. If I 
have a MiB, I would still have to convert them to SI prefixes. I really don&#8217;t 
see the point why I should use another prefix just because it is a byte and 
not, say, a meter.

I guess, the main purpose of the binary prefixes is to clarify that kilo is 
only 1000, not 1024.

3. I don&#8217;t really know. But because the format_filesize() function returns a 
string, I guess it is not used for calculations, just for display? That way, 
I don&#8217;t think it would do any harm. I guess, gpodder uses a byte size without 
any prefix for calculations? This is the same in all versions. 20000 Byte are 
always 20000 Byte.

You might want to take a look at these:

<A HREF="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin%C3%A4rpr%C3%A4fix">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin%C3%A4rpr%C3%A4fix</A>
<A HREF="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI-Pr%C3%A4fix">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI-Pr%C3%A4fix</A>

Oh, I just saw, the symbol for kilo is k, not K. My mistake.
