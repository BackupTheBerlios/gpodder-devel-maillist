These are the exact cases when using the title is not possible, although
they _do_ happen with certain feeds. People will complain about a feed
not working if one of these cases happens and is not handled correctly.

&gt;<i> That is, the title is only unsuitable quite rarely. If this is the

</I>
That would be an option, although it makes the code more complex and
therefore error-prone. If we change the algorithm used to determine the
file names (a better algorithm comes up, bugs are fixed, ...), it could
be possible that episodes downloaded now will not be accessible and
reachable by newer gPodder versions.

Another problem I see with your approach is how to handle duplicates (we
have to save the files with unique filenames, but then also get the
right unique filename from a title). This has to be handled with another
file that has to save the generated name (so we have a URL-&gt;unique name
mapping).

In my opinion, it's just too much housekeeping and invites a bunch of
problems. As I mentioned in my earlier mail, if RSS feeds would be
&quot;sane&quot;, and we could trust their content, it would be much easier indeed
(just look at the feed loading code in libpodcasts.py).

&gt;<i> If the set rules are always used then the program can always tell if
</I>&gt;<i> it should use the title or a hash.
</I>
Yes, but it also makes it difficult for other programs to determine the
filename of a feed or episode given the URL. Other programs that want to
operate on gPodder's download folder then have to know (and import or
implement) the exact algorithm used in gPodder, and you can imagine what
happens when this algorithm changes and other programs are not updated
with the new algorithm.

The title/hash method is theoretically very nice, but makes maintaining
all those bits and pieces cumbersome.

What I'd rather implement is a way of doing a &quot;mirror&quot; with hard links
to files on your local hard drive. Unfortunately, hard links are not
supported by the FAT filesystem, and I have heard some users have their
gPodder download directory set to a FAT drive/usb stick. Hard links are
necessary to not duplicate disk space requirements (like a soft link,
but it appears as regular file).
