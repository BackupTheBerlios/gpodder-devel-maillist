Thanks for your patch. I've been thinking about converting the current
display of &quot;new&quot; episodes to a graphical representation (i.e. not
text-only but a bit like the display in iTunes). So, I tried to combine
your patch with the cairo drawing code I've done. Here's a screenshot:

<A HREF="http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/gpodder-cairo-status.png">http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/gpodder-cairo-status.png</A>

The left (light) number is the number of unplayed episodes, the right
(dark) number is the number of episodes downloaded. I still have to fix
up the drawing code a bit, as it's very ugly at the moment (both
code-wise and result-wise). When there are no unplayed episodes, the
left part disappears, and when there are no episodes that have been
downloaded, the right part also disappears (see, for example, &quot;LugRadio&quot;
and &quot;Security Now!&quot; in the posted screenshot).

What do you and the others think of this?

&gt;<i> Currently in the combo list if there are new episodes to download the channel 
</I>&gt;<i> text is marked up in *bold* and the count of new episodes is on the right.   I 
</I>&gt;<i> felt that the count indication was redundant as the *bold *text told me I had 
</I>&gt;<i> new episodes to download. I therefore set out to use this field to tell me how 
</I>&gt;<i> many unread episodes I have out of the amount I had downloaded.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The screenshot at <A HREF="http://www.thegithouse.com/files/Screenshot.jpg">http://www.thegithouse.com/files/Screenshot.jpg</A> shows the 
</I>&gt;<i> result,   if we take the 'This American Life' podcast as an example, this shows 
</I>&gt;<i> that I have 10 unread episodes out of a total of 12 that I have 
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded....time for some serious listening!
</I>
That's great. I'm still wondering if people would also like to see the
amount of new episodes in the channel navigator, or if the bold text (as
you described it) is enough indication for new episodes.


Thanks
Thomas
