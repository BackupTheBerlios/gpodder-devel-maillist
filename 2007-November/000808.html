</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The current version of gPodder did not provide me with this information so my

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> succeeded and have made some slight changes to the combo list GUI which I would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like your feedback on.  If the feedback is positive then perhaps Thomas would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willing to merge into the SVN trunk?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your patch. I've been thinking about converting the current
</I>&gt;<i> display of &quot;new&quot; episodes to a graphical representation (i.e. not
</I>&gt;<i> text-only but a bit like the display in iTunes). So, I tried to combine
</I>&gt;<i> your patch with the cairo drawing code I've done. Here's a screenshot:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/gpodder-cairo-status.png">http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/gpodder-cairo-status.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The left (light) number is the number of unplayed episodes, the right
</I>&gt;<i> (dark) number is the number of episodes downloaded. I still have to fix
</I>&gt;<i> up the drawing code a bit, as it's very ugly at the moment (both
</I>&gt;<i> code-wise and result-wise). When there are no unplayed episodes, the
</I>&gt;<i> left part disappears, and when there are no episodes that have been
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded, the right part also disappears (see, for example, &quot;LugRadio&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;Security Now!&quot; in the posted screenshot).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you and the others think of this?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think this looks great!  Go with it!
&gt;<i> Currently in the combo list if there are new episodes to download the channel 
</I>&gt;<i> text is marked up in *bold* and the count of new episodes is on the right.   I 
</I>&gt;<i> felt that the count indication was redundant as the *bold *text told me I had 
</I>&gt;<i> new episodes to download. I therefore set out to use this field to tell me how 
</I>&gt;<i> many unread episodes I have out of the amount I had downloaded.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The screenshot at <A HREF="http://www.thegithouse.com/files/Screenshot.jpg">http://www.thegithouse.com/files/Screenshot.jpg</A> shows the 
</I>&gt;<i> result,   if we take the 'This American Life' podcast as an example, this shows 
</I>&gt;<i> that I have 10 unread episodes out of a total of 12 that I have 
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded....time for some serious listening!
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's great. I'm still wondering if people would also like to see the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of new episodes in the channel navigator, or if the bold text (as
</I>&gt;<i> you described it) is enough indication for new episodes.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think with the new episode selection dialog you added to the SVN trunk 
recently, this provides the detailed required for new downloads.  I'd be 
interested to hear other people's views.

Keep up the good work.

Paul
&gt;<i> Thanks
