<PRE>Hi Thomas and fellow gPodders.

For a while I have been wanting to be able to see at a glance how many 
unplayed episodes there are for each of my podcasts.   That way I would 
know which ones I needed to catch up on! 

The current version of gPodder did not provide me with this information 
so my challenge was to see if I could make the changes myself (being 
both new to Linux and Python this seemed impossible a few days ago).  
Anyway I think that I have succeeded and have made some slight changes 
to the combo list GUI which I would like your feedback on.  If the 
feedback is positive then perhaps Thomas would be willing to merge into 
the SVN trunk?

Currently in the combo list if there are new episodes to download the 
channel text is marked up in *bold* and the count of new episodes is on 
the right.   I felt that the count indication was redundant as the *bold 
*text told me I had new episodes to download. I therefore set out to use 
this field to tell me how many unread episodes I have out of the amount 
I had downloaded.  

The screenshot at <A HREF="http://www.thegithouse.com/files/Screenshot.jpg">http://www.thegithouse.com/files/Screenshot.jpg</A> shows 
the result,   if we take the 'This American Life' podcast as an example, 
this shows that I have 10 unread episodes out of a total of 12 that I 
have downloaded....time for some serious listening!

I have also attached a patch file which you could apply to your own 
source if you would like to try it!

Paul
