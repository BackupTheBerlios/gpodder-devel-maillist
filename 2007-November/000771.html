</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been looking through the suggestions and an idea that didn't come

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and file names. For example it could look something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ~/{download dir}/{number}-{&lt;title&gt; (cut off if too long)}/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; {number}-{show title (also cut off if too long) or original

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ~/gpodder-downloads/03-This_Week_in_Tech/19-Some_random_show.mp3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The numbers could be assigned randomly (in that case a bigger number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be needed) or the numbers could simply be counters that gpodder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keeps track of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this would be nicer than having to descend through many oddly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; named directories to find a show you're looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your proposal sounds reasonable, and it might be something we should
</I>&gt;<i> think about if we are going to change the internal structure of the
</I>&gt;<i> download folder. Of course, we have to make a number-URL mapping and
</I>&gt;<i> save that somewhere so we can always find the right number to determine
</I>&gt;<i> the file name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I've been working on a compatible hard-linking system that will
</I>&gt;<i> preserve the download folder structure, generate a new structure that
</I>&gt;<i> (given it resides on the same filesystem as the download folder and it
</I>&gt;<i> supports hard links) will not use any additional hard disk space and is
</I>&gt;<i> even compatible with renames.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Save the two attached scripts somewhere in your $PATH and don't forget
</I>&gt;<i> to set the PYTHONPATH variable to the &quot;src/&quot; subfolder of your SVN
</I>&gt;<i> checkout, so the scripts will find the gPodder libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Usage: gdfs-init.py [--yes] [Podcasts dir]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Populates &quot;Podcasts dir&quot; with hard links from gPodder's
</I>&gt;<i>         downloads folder. &quot;Podcasts dir&quot; should be on the same
</I>&gt;<i>         filesystem as the downloads folder, and the filesystem
</I>&gt;<i>         has to support hard links.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If &quot;Podcasts dir&quot; already exists, the script will ask
</I>&gt;<i>         to overwrite its contents and re-build the mirror.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The optional &quot;--yes&quot; parameter will skip the overwrite
</I>&gt;<i>         question and foribly re-build the folder if it exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Usage: gdfs-check.py [from-gpodder|from-podcasts] [Podcasts dir]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If you have deleted episodes from your Podcast mirror
</I>&gt;<i>         folder, use &quot;from-podcasts&quot; to get a list of files
</I>&gt;<i>         that you have to delete from gPodder's download
</I>&gt;<i>         folder to &quot;sync&quot; with your podcast mirror.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If you have deleted episodes in gPodder, you can use
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;from-gpodder&quot; to get a list of files that are still
</I>&gt;<i>         available in your podcasts dir, but not in gPodder's
</I>&gt;<i>         download directory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, basically, to get things going, download the two scripts to your
</I>&gt;<i> Desktop, run &quot;python gdfs-init.py --yes Podcasts&quot; and you should have
</I>&gt;<i> your podcasts in human-readable folder and file names on your Desktop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can always refresh this &quot;mirror&quot; of your download directory by
</I>&gt;<i> running the same command again, which will overwrite the old &quot;Podcasts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> folder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please try out these scripts and tell me how they work for you. Maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> can do some more integration into gPodder when things are tested and
</I>&gt;<i> users are happy with this solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

It works great, I didn't notice any problems. It's funny because I was 
thinking of something similar but disregarded the idea because it seemed too 
complicated, but you did it :)

If a few more people could test it (maybe people with big gpodder libraries) I 
think it would be a really cool feature.
