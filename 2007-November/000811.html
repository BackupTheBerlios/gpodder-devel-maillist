<PRE>Hello, gPodder developers and users!

Our monthly release cycle continues with gPodder 0.10.2, out just now.
You can grab the source tarball now or wait until your distribution
updates its gPodder packages for the new upstream version.

Thanks to all who were involved, I hope I didn't forget someone in the
list below.

One feature that was in the works last week but didn't make it into this
release is the advanced channel navigator. I didn't think my code was
stable and well-tested enough to make it into a release just yet, so
this feature, based on a patch[1] by Paul Rudkin will be added shortly
after the release to our subversion repository, so we will have another
month for testing and improving this feature.

As always, below are the release notes from the website and the website
is also where you will find the download links:

Thanks,
Thomas

=========================
November has been a busy month for gPodder so far, and so we're happy to
present you yet another feature-packed release of your favourite
podcatcher: gPodder 0.10.2! In the last few weeks, we've added a new
episode selection dialog, added the new configuration and settings
manager that has been in the works since mid-October and also spiced up
the channel navigator a bit with nice, helpful tooltips.

Apart from that, the usual code maintenance work has carried on, and we
also nailed a bunch of bugs. Coincidentally, there have been several bug
reports about disk I/O problems, mostly related to full disks, so these
bugs are now handled gracefully and with notification dialog boxes.

Gerrit Sangel proposed correct displaying of file size units (SI units
aka 10x versus &quot;Binary&quot; units aka 2x). We still default to binary units,
but you can set the configuration flag use_si_units to True to enable
the displaying of SI units throughout gPodder.
Highlights

    * New configuration/settings manager (&quot;under the hood&quot;)
    * Universal episode selector dialog
    * Tooltips for channel navigator

Features

    * Open download folder from channel's context menu
    * format_filesize() now does standards-conformant formatting (binary
and SI units)
    * Cover art extraction is now done using eyeD3 (thanks to Nick)
    * Option for synchronizing to MP3 players without creating
subfolders (suggested by Paul Elliot)
    * &quot;Remove old episodes&quot; (Ctrl+K) that uses the new episode selector
    * Check free disk space before copying files to iPod (suggested by
Nicolas Quienot)
    * Main menu has been re-organized, slipstreamed (e.g. device sync
disappears when no device is selected)
    * Updated translation: German

Code changes

    * Removed dependency on pyID3 (we now use eyeD3 for extracting cover
art)
    * Remove extracted cover art when deleting episode files (improved)
    * Detection of available commands is now done using the new
util.find_command() function
    * The gdfs scripts are now part of the source distribution
    * Better file extension guessing for URLs (suggested by Nicolas Quienot)
    * Code slipstreamed (e.g. use enumerate(), etc..)
    * Backwards-compatibility code for PyGTK &lt; 2.12 (for GtkTooltip)
    * We now recommend Python &gt;= 2.4 and PyGTK &gt;= 2.12

Bugfixes

    * Escape even more RSS-provided strings in Pango markup
    * Limit filename on FS-based sync to 50 characters (so FAT drives
won't complain)
    * Better command detection for the converter library (Patch by Nick)
    * Add error reporting when download fails because of an I/O error
(suggested by Florian Richter)
    * Feed cache: Improve offline cache behaviour, periodically clean-up
cache file, HTTP redirects
    * Fix filesize formatting in episode selector and podcastItem
(thanks to Pieter de Decker)
    * Don't send Referer header when downloading episodes (bugs with
anti-bandwith-stealing scripts)
    * Make sure there is enough free disk space when saving OPML channel
list (reported by Jens Thiele; Debian Bug #452490)

Thanks

    * Nick: eyeD3 cover art extraction patch; converter detection patch
    * Gerrit Sangel: Filesize unit patch (SI and binary units); testing
and suggestions
    * Florian Richter: Bug reporting (download error when disk is full)
    * Paul Elliot: Suggested MP3 player sync without folder
    * Pieter De Decker: Bug reporting (filesize in episode selector)
    * Nicolas Quienot: Bug reporting (URL file extension guessing; iPod
free disk space)
    * Jens Thiele: Bug reporting (full disk channel list saving)
