Hello,

I've been looking through the suggestions and an idea that didn't come up was 
a simple enumeration at the beginning or ending of directory and file names. 
For example it could look something like this:

~/{download dir}/{number}-{&lt;title&gt; (cut off if too long)}/
{number}-{show title (also cut off if too long) or original filename}.ext

~/gpodder-downloads/03-This_Week_in_Tech/19-Some_random_show.mp3

The numbers could be assigned randomly (in that case a bigger number would be 
needed) or the numbers could simply be counters that gpodder keeps track of.

I think this would be nicer than having to descend through many oddly named 
directories to find a show you're looking for.

Just my $0.02,

nick
