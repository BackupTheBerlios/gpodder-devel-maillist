Your proposal sounds reasonable, and it might be something we should
think about if we are going to change the internal structure of the
download folder. Of course, we have to make a number-URL mapping and
save that somewhere so we can always find the right number to determine
the file name.

Anyway, I've been working on a compatible hard-linking system that will
preserve the download folder structure, generate a new structure that
(given it resides on the same filesystem as the download folder and it
supports hard links) will not use any additional hard disk space and is
even compatible with renames.

Save the two attached scripts somewhere in your $PATH and don't forget
to set the PYTHONPATH variable to the &quot;src/&quot; subfolder of your SVN
checkout, so the scripts will find the gPodder libraries.

    Usage: gdfs-init.py [--yes] [Podcasts dir]

        Populates &quot;Podcasts dir&quot; with hard links from gPodder's
        downloads folder. &quot;Podcasts dir&quot; should be on the same
        filesystem as the downloads folder, and the filesystem
        has to support hard links.

        If &quot;Podcasts dir&quot; already exists, the script will ask 
        to overwrite its contents and re-build the mirror.

        The optional &quot;--yes&quot; parameter will skip the overwrite
        question and foribly re-build the folder if it exists.

    Usage: gdfs-check.py [from-gpodder|from-podcasts] [Podcasts dir]

        If you have deleted episodes from your Podcast mirror
        folder, use &quot;from-podcasts&quot; to get a list of files 
        that you have to delete from gPodder's download
        folder to &quot;sync&quot; with your podcast mirror.

        If you have deleted episodes in gPodder, you can use
        &quot;from-gpodder&quot; to get a list of files that are still 
        available in your podcasts dir, but not in gPodder's
        download directory.

So, basically, to get things going, download the two scripts to your
Desktop, run &quot;python gdfs-init.py --yes Podcasts&quot; and you should have
your podcasts in human-readable folder and file names on your Desktop.

You can always refresh this &quot;mirror&quot; of your download directory by
running the same command again, which will overwrite the old &quot;Podcasts&quot;
folder.

Please try out these scripts and tell me how they work for you. Maybe we
can do some more integration into gPodder when things are tested and
users are happy with this solution.
