Looking at the code: setting an attribute appears to be a heavy-weight
operation anyways: when an attribute is changed, save is typically
(always?) called immediately.  In this case, the overhead of the
__setattr__ implementation (likely a few microseconds) is secondary
relative to the database transaction (likely tens of milliseconds).
Moreover, your suggestion adds an additional database interaction for
most (all?) attribute changes.

</I>
It's not clear to my why disabling the code in the __setattr__
function is more difficult to disable than having the code in the save
method: episode.__setattr__ = object.__setattr__.

&gt;<i> (I don't want to have it
</I>&gt;<i>   enabled by default, as it does not yet provide an advantage in the
</I>&gt;<i>   generic case where woodchuck isn't used).
</I>
This is reasonable although I maintain that the cost is negligible
relative to the database transaction that follows.


I'm willing to implement what you suggest, but I'm not convinced that
it is the better way.  I think the __setattr__ implementation is less
complicated and less expensive than chnaging save, but, if you
disagree, I won't argue further, but will implement what you suggest.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Neal
