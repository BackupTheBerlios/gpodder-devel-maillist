Thanks, some feedback:

 * The &quot;woodchuck&quot; module should go in src/gpodder/plugins/
 * The DEFAULT_PLUGINS in src/gpodder/__init__.py should be modified
   accordingly
 * What's the purpose of &quot;mainthread.py&quot;? It's not documented :/
 * Please remove the shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env python2.5) in
   mainthread.py (if you want to run it, you can use &quot;python -m
   gpodder.mainthread&quot;) - also, don't hardcode python2.5
 * Constants (like refresh_interval in woodchuck.py) should be uppercase
 * The &quot;config&quot; object is never used in mywoodchuck - is it really
   necessary to pass this object through? (if so, why?)
 * The extracting of a single podcast channel via URL is done multiple
   times in mywoodchuck's code. Better write a get_podcast(url) function
   that will take care of the filtering and logging of the warning,
   returning None when the podcast channel is not found
 * The same is probably true for get_episode(podcast, url), where the
   first argument is already a podcast channel object and the second is
   the URL of the episode (+returning None, etc)
 * For episodes, the unique identifier should be the GUID, because it
   might be possible that feeds publish different items at the same URL
   (yes, this is very crappy, but it has happened before..)
 * The changes support that you implemented in the model is only used
   for the code in on_podcast_save? If so, what's the problem with
   unconditionally copying the title to the human_readable_name (or
   adding a hook for on_podcast_title_changed). The same is for
   on_podcast_url_changed - there are only a few cases (HTTP redirect
   and after gpodder.net subscription uploads) where the URL of a
   podcast really changes in gPodder.
 * In the any statements, if you don't use list comprehension, but
   rather a generator expression, it might perform better - any can stop
   after the first positive result, the list comprehension builds a list
   of booleans and then any uses this list to determine its result. Just
   leaving out the square brackets should do the trick :)
 * Please adhere to PEP-8[1] where possible. Don't add spaces after
   function names (NOT: self.auto_download (stream, obj)).
 * You can probably shrink the length of &quot;check_subscriptions&quot; by using
   set() and its functions difference() and intersection().
 * For idle_add, maybe you want to use gpodder.util.idle_add? ;)

HTH :)

Thanks,
Thomas
