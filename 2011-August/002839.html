Here is some feedback on your commits:

* 97165b78eaca440fc17264ddcadd549303f18eba (Add more hooks)

  This one looks good to me already; about that &quot;XXX&quot; - yes, you
  probably want to call the hook on every downloaded episode (i.e.
  get_downloaded_episodes()). After that, it's ready for a merge.

* 2f2c52d13a0a77aec873b5be2717dda6fab2a064 (Interface to register...)

  If you enable the HookManager unconditionally, we should probably
  remove the &quot;if gpodder.user_hooks is not None&quot; conditions throughout
  the code. In this case, we have to make sure that all frontends use
  the &quot;Core&quot; class, but that's probably a good idea anyway (especially
  since the core class does not depend on many things, and just provides
  the DB and configuration)

  Some other thing: Why do you need the register_hooks() method?
  Wouldn't a hook script in the hooks folder provide the registration
  automatically with the current setup?

* 9d8223f626b5f7f3e30151b05304da9badc099e8 (Record the attrs that change)

  I don't really like this one, as it involves quite some code each time
  an attribute is set. It would be better if you implemented it so that
  it only works on save() and there it loads the data from the database
  and compares both dictionaries for changes. This way, there's only one
  place (the save() method) where the changes are tracked, and it's easy
  to maintain and overview this piece of code, while still having the
  option to easily disable the change tracking (I don't want to have it
  enabled by default, as it does not yet provide an advantage in the
  generic case where woodchuck isn't used).


Thanks,
Thomas
