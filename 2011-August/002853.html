No, I don't like this approach and also not the one with the flag.
However, I think we should have some support in place for gPodder to run
in some kind of &quot;headless&quot; mode when it has not started. Can you file a
bug for this (as feature request) on bugs.gpodder.org that we can use to
track this feature?

HTH.
