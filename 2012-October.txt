Dear Amarok, Clementine & gPodder Community,

long time (nearly a year) passed since the last libmygpo-qt release.
Today there was the first gPodder hackday (of many more to come) and
so it was time to fix some bugs, test the library a little bit and
make a new release ;)

I'm looking for contributors, so if you wanna work on a
interesting library used atm by Amarok, Clementine & Nokia Podcasts,
drop me a line ;)

Changes in 1.0.6:
- -) added support for DeviceSync API [0]. This API makes it possible to
set up synchronization with existing gpodder.net devices from inside
your application
- -) set Contenttype Header to avoid warnings with Qt 4.8
- -) some fixes & enhancements to CMake build system

What is libmygpo-qt?

libmygpo-qt is a Qt/C++ Library wrapping the gPodder.net Webservice. It
was created as part of a University Course & it is used in
Amarok (since 2.4.1) with the new gpodder.net
Service, that makes the gpodder.net Podcast Directory available from
within Amarok. Also it is used in Nokia Podcasts and will be used in
Clementine from v1.1 onwards.
