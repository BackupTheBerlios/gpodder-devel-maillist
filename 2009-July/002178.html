<PRE>I am using LinuxMint 7 with the default theme and the emblems are not
correct, but when I switched to the theme called LinuxMint which is from an
older release, the emblems were correct.

Ian, what OS are you running? If you are also running Mint, I'd say there is
a problem with the Mint icon themes.
