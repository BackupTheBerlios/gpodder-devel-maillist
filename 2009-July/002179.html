</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I am using the stock theme for Ubuntu Jaunty. In the list view, I am 
getting a green tick for unplayed and nothing for played. My confusion 
arises from the icon in the pop menu when I right click. If the track is 
unplayed I get Green Tick Mark as Played. If it's played I get white x 
on red background icon, with menu text &quot;Mark as Unplayed&quot;.

IMHO the icon in the pop up menu should reflect the state in the menu 
text. &quot;Mark as Played&quot; should show nothing and &quot;Mark as Unplayed&quot; should 
show the green tick.

Personally, I find using a &quot;tick&quot; to indicate the unplayed state counter 
intuitive. A tick would suggest to me it has been played, as in ticked 
off in the list of things to do.

Ian.
