<PRE>Hey there!

This is just a quick release push for the next version of
gPodder, so it gets more public exposure. Also, this release
fixes some annoying bugs that have been in 0.16.1 and have
not been fixed in a public release since then, so this should
allow many users to have a better gPodder experience.

Thanks to all who were involved with this release!

Anyone willing to join the release management and learn how
to package gPodder is invited to write a short mail to me.


Thanks,
Thomas

2009-07-27: gPodder 0.17.0 &quot;Orientation&quot; released

Even though the summer is hot, and updates are slow, we are proud to
give you yet another great gPodder release with some bug fixes and
improvements to the efficiency of the feed updating code. Here's what's
happened:

Bernd Schlapsi (1):
      corrected an error happened in commit 41b6e827c

Bill Peters (1):
      Changes made to exclude *.dat files from the edit device
        playlist util. I did this because my Blackberry mp3
        device creates a BBThumbs.dat file in every podcast
        folder. Not sure if this is the best way to solve it
        but it does the job for me.

Jim Nyg&#229;rd (1):
      Updated Norwegian Bokm&#229;l translation

Marco Antonio Villegas Vega (1):
      Let add a podcast completely from keyboard

Morten Nygaard &#197;snes (2):
      Added GPODDER_CHANNEL_TITLE variable to cmd_download_complete
hook.
      Monkey-patch feedparser to support Media RSS (bug 507)

Paul Rudkin (3):
      Bug 406 - Auto download option now available when gPodder
        is maxmized. Advanced option will allow end user to
        ihibit display of new episodes dialog
      Bug 406 Removed code that linked to old check box for
        auto_download_when_minimized - this is no longer used
      Added advanced option to allow user to change behaviour when
        an episode is double clicked (Bug 38)

Philippe Dessante (1):
      Updated French translation

Silvio Sisto (1):
      Updated Spanish translation

Thomas Perl (29):
      Fix another bug with hanging downloads
      Simplify and clean-up feed update code in gui.py
      First cut of new feedcore module + related changes
      Initial work on statistics-based update optimizations
      Fix a bug with bad episode filenames
      Do not use &quot;while I&quot;/&quot;while gPodder&quot; in messages
      Fix feed update bug for password-protected feeds
      Only depend on GTK for GUI things in util (bug 495)
      Simplify Bluetooth-related tasks by removing options
      Remove support for custom HTTP proxy settings
      Remove libtagupdate + related functionality
      Remove use_si_units and get length from HTTP header preferences
      Fix encoding issue with German translation (bug 488)
      Update list of contributors/donators
      Do not enable install button in dependency manager
      Enable streaming when audioplayer is set (bug 93)
      Fix UnicodeDecodeError on Windows (bug 449)
      Use proper emblems for the episode list (bug 467)
      Fix bug in playback with default player
      Clean and split up on_treeAvailable_row_activated
      Remove support for writing the gtkpod extended DB (bug 68)
      Disable &quot;Delete&quot; accelerator in downloads tab
      Support for playback of multiple files (bug 120)
      Always create M3U playlists in download folder
      Fix streaming for deleted episodes
      Remove podcast_sidebar_save_space config option (bug 508)
      Update all translation files from source
      Don't overwrite backup files with gpodder-backup
      gPodder 0.17.0 &quot;Orientation&quot; released

Tim Gilbert (1):
      Add free disk space detection on Windows (bug 468)

Enjoy this new release of gPodder! And enjoy the summer.
