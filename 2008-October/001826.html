<PRE>Hi all,

A repost with a smaller attachment, I hope it'll work this time. The problem: gpodder seems to disconnect my internet connection. This has been happening for the last couple of weeks, but I wanted to make sure that gpodder is the cause and not some random problem.

When I start gpodder, it starts updating the channels (22 channels in total). During the update process, the internet connection gets disconnected several times, usually for about 30 seconds or so. After that, internet connectivity is restored, and gpodder updates until the next disconnect. During disconnect events I cannot use firefox or so. However, after a while the connection comes back to life without intervention (I don't need to restart modem and / or network card etc). Once the channels have been updated, the subsequent downloads are OK and my internet connection is stable until the next gpodder channel update. As can be seen in the attached log file, there are multiple 'connection refused' statements. The disconnections seem to NOT be correlated to a specific feed, i.e. there seems to be no particular feed reliably causing a network disconnect.

Is there anybody else with this problem? How can I find more information to determine the root cause of the problem? Some more seemingly relevant info: I'm in the US (Atlanta GA), with a Comcast cable internet connection. Motorola Surfboard cable modem with Linksys router, LAN (cable) connection to Linksys. I use a Thinkpad T40 with gentoo linux.

Cheers,
Wilfred
