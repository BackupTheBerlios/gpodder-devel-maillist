&gt;<i> When I start gpodder, it starts updating the channels (22 channels in total). During the update process, the internet connection gets disconnected several times, usually for about 30 seconds or so. After that, internet connectivity is restored, and gpodder updates until the next disconnect. During disconnect events I cannot use firefox or so. However, after a while the connection comes back to life without intervention (I don't need to restart modem and / or network card etc). Once the channels have been updated, the subsequent downloads are OK and my internet connection is stable until the next gpodder channel update. As can be seen in the attached log file, there are multiple 'connection refused' statements. The disconnections seem to NOT be correlated to a specific feed, i.e. there seems to be no particular feed reliably causing a network disconnect.

Can you cause the problem by downloading large files via curl or your
webbrowser?  I'm wondering if the only large files you get are coming
thru gpodder and thus it looks like the culprit..
