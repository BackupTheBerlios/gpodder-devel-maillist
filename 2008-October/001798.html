Some of the old episodes that do not appear in the feed anymore and
have no corresponding file will be deleted when the Maemo
Optimization patches (Leonid's and Nick's work) are merged.

We can of course implement a view where all deleted (trash can)
episodes will be hidden from display. I don't have time at the moment,
so your best best would be to add a feature request to
<A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org">http://bugs.gpodder.org</A> or ask one of the guys at #gpodder on FreeNode
IRC for help. Maybe they can guide you through the process of making
that feature happen :)
