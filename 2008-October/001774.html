<PRE>Hello there!

We've talked about gPodder's new icon in the past few weeks, but the
discussion has since been put down a little, so I'm now going to set
things straight and define how we move forward with the new icon,
because I'd like to have this wrapped up soon, and Kalle Persson, who
has kindly agreed to work on the new icon and already provided some
very good suggestions, would probably also like to wrap this up, too.

This is how we are going to do it (given Kalle still wants to do the
icon, which I really hope, because he's done the new Gnome Do icon[1]
recently, which looks really sexy!):

 1.) Kalle Persson will do his version of the icon (i.e. the podcast
     icon as metaphor -&gt; the icon as in [2], but without the globe or
     at least the podcast icon more prominent than the globe) how
     he wants to do it. Someone suggested changing the color of the
     podcast icon to orange - Kalle decides if we should do this. My
     only requests are that the podcast icon is more prominent than
     the globe icon so the icon doesn't look like the web browser icon.

 2.) The green man icon will be ONLY in the About Dialog and on the
     website after Kalle has finished the work on the new icon

 3.) Kalle's icon will appear everywhere else (applications menu, window
     icon, website favicon, ...)

 4.) I will refresh the green man icon's look for the new website and
     the about dialog, to look a bit more modern and more Tango-ish ;)


Thanks,
Thomas
