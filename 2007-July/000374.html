<PRE>Hello, Carlos!

Carlos Moffat schrie
&gt;<i> I'd like to use gpodder as a podcast catcher, but I don't want to use it
</I>&gt;<i> to play the podcasts. The problem is that with the way the
</I>&gt;<i> folder/filename naming scheme (using some kind of hash), it's quite hard
</I>&gt;<i> to find anything using the file manager or a music player (without
</I>&gt;<i> reading all the files into the library). It would be great if one could
</I>&gt;<i> store the podcast into folders/filenames that are human-readable.
</I>First, the explanation: The reason gPodder uses a hash of the URL to 
store its channels and episodes is because you can't rely on titles of 
channels and episodes from RSS feeds (i.e. two episodes with the same 
name or two different podcasts of the same radio station both named 
&quot;Radio Foo Podcast&quot;). Using hashes of URLs resolves this problem - if an 
episode URL is the same, there is no problem with the file name also 
being the same (the same URL should resolve to the same content).

Now, here's the solution to your problem: gPodder has a &quot;sync&quot; feature. 
If you set the sync target to &quot;FS-based MP3 player&quot; and select a local 
folder where you want to store the podcasts, and start the 
synchronization, gPodder will create a &quot;Channel Name/Episode Name.ext&quot; 
directory structure there and copy all files over. This way, you can 
easily browse your podcasts on the filesystem.

Hope that solves your problem and answers your question :)


Enjoy,
Thomas
