</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; store the podcast into folders/filenames that are human-readable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, the explanation: The reason gPodder uses a hash of the URL
</I>&gt;<i> to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; store its channels and episodes is because you can't rely on titles
</I>&gt;<i> of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channels and episodes from RSS feeds (i.e. two episodes with the
</I>&gt;<i> same 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name or two different podcasts of the same radio station both named 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Radio Foo Podcast&quot;). Using hashes of URLs resolves this problem -
</I>&gt;<i> if an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; episode URL is the same, there is no problem with the file name
</I>&gt;<i> also 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being the same (the same URL should resolve to the same content).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see. Although the client I'm trying to migrate from (castpodder,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> will die any time now as is no longer being mantained) correctly
</I>&gt;<i> creates
</I>&gt;<i> a folder/episode structure.
</I>
I don't know about castpodder, but maybe it's just a one-way downloader
without the ability to manage, synchronize and browse podcast episodes.

We had title-based file and folder naming before, but it resulted in
many problems with buggy feeds. Well, we even had a bug in the Debian
BTS about a user complaining about missing titles - the RSS feed in
question had no &lt;title&gt; tags. Therefore, gPodder tries to avoid these
problems and to accept any RSS file it gets thrown at it.

&gt;<i> &gt; Now, here's the solution to your problem: gPodder has a &quot;sync&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> feature. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you set the sync target to &quot;FS-based MP3 player&quot; and select a
</I>&gt;<i> local 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folder where you want to store the podcasts, and start the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronization, gPodder will create a &quot;Channel Name/Episode
</I>&gt;<i> Name.ext&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory structure there and copy all files over. This way, you
</I>&gt;<i> can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily browse your podcasts on the filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MMhh. Doesn't this mean that podcasts will use twice as much space in
</I>&gt;<i> my hard drive? This is big no-no as they're already taking 5.2GB. 
</I>
Yes, but if you're not needing the podcast management functions of
gPodder, you will be able to delete the episodes from gPodder after
sync. gPodder will remember which episodes have been downloaded and
deleted, and will skip these episodes when searching for new episodes.

A feature that hard-links these files could be implemented, but I don't
have time to do this right now, as the function as it is now serves me
and many others well.


Enjoy,
Thomas
