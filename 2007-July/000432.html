To really create a good package for a distribution, you should look at
the distributions' package documentation. I use Debian and am following
the manuals found on the Debian website, including the Python Policy
(only relevant when you're building a package with Python modules).

I create the Debian packaging for gPodder myself, and the Debian source
package is built on Ubuntu to produce the Ubuntu package.

For Gentoo's portage, I've initially asked a personal friend of mine to
do the packaging (a Gentoo user familiar with portage) and later Hanno
took over maintenance. I just saw the portage package isn't kept up to
date right now.

RPMs are created for Fedora Core by a Red Hat maintainer, which seems to
work very good so far.

Creating .debs or .rpms with &quot;checkinstall&quot; is fine for local
installations, but distributions aren't going to accept the package into
their repositories. If you just want to provide .debs or .rpms for easy
installation on your homepage (and not in the distributions'
repositories), you might also want to take the easy route and publish
checkinstall-created packages.

In short, packaging software &quot;by hand&quot; is the Right Thing to do,
everything else won't work in the long run. I can help you with the
Debian (and also Ubuntu) packaging, if you want, as time permits.


Enjoy,
Thomas
