I think Nick is talking about libgpod here. Make sure you have a recent
stable version of the library and its Python bindings. All iPod-related
issues are most likely related to libgpod, as this library is
responsible for writing/updating the iTunesDB.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, my iPod doesn't seem to work &quot;out of the box&quot;? (It is a 6th
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generation iPod Nano). I first have to &quot;Create iPod Folders&quot; using gtkpod

It's a known limitation, that's right. If you completely erase your
iPod, you have to &quot;init&quot; it again using gtkpod. If this functionality
can be provided by libgpod (please ask there), it'd be easy for gPodder
to simply do something like (in pseudocode):

if gpod.ipod_has_not_been_inited(ipod_path):
    gpod.create_ipod_folders(ipod_path)

Re-implementing this functionality in gPodder is not what I want to do,
as I only have an old iPod mini, and it Works For Me(tm). Initialization
of an iPod is what belongs in gtkpod or libgpod. And if in libgpod, we
should utilize the functionality to automagically initialize the iPod.

I'll gladly accept patches to support newer-generation iPods where
possible, though.


Thanks,
Thomas
