I've implemented the &quot;out of disk&quot; error handling for FS-based MP3
players a few days ago, have a look at the changelog and the
corresponding commit diffs. It wouldn't be too hard to add this
functionality for iPod sync. AFAIR it's just a matter of adding the rror
message to the &quot;errors&quot; list and returning &quot;False&quot;, setting &quot;cancelled&quot;
to true, etc.. See the gPodder_FSSync object for an example.

I currently don't have much time, as it's a busy week, so I'll gladly
accept patches for this. It'd be a nice addition for 0.9.4, but if we
don't get the patch in in time, we'd have to release without this
patched, which would be a bit sad ;)


Thanks,
Thomas
