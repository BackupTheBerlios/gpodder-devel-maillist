<PRE>Hello, Nick!

In your patch, you have

+        self.channel.username = self.FeedUsername.get_text().strip()
+        self.channel.password = self.FeedPassword.get_text().strip()

Wouldn't that cause the password to stop working when you have a
password like &quot;asdf &quot;, i.e. a space after the character content? I can
see your point in doing it for the username field, but maybe we should
not use strip() for the password field, hm?

&gt;<i> Attached is a patch against svn revision 351 to add the ability to download 
</I>&gt;<i> podcasts from password protected server directories. It stores the username 
</I>&gt;<i> and password in the index.xml files in each local podcast directory. The 
</I>&gt;<i> passwords are obfuscated using a simple mapping table and the 
</I>&gt;<i> string.translate function. I know this isn't secure but I don't think it's 
</I>&gt;<i> advisable to store the passwords in plaintext either. The username and 
</I>&gt;<i> password are set via the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab in the &quot;Edit channel information&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> dialogue. 
</I>
I see your point, but the password is passed as plain-text argument to
wget, so for the time of the download, it will be visible in the &quot;ps&quot;
list in plain text. string.translate as I see it in the patch also makes
the available characters only be from the ASCII charset, UTF-8 would be
so much better.

&gt;<i> If you would like to test it, I set up a feed and password protected directory 
</I>&gt;<i> on my server (with a 5 second &quot;podcast&quot; I made). Here's the info for that:
</I>&gt;<i> feed url: <A HREF="http://nikosapi.org/test_protected_feed/feed.xml">http://nikosapi.org/test_protected_feed/feed.xml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> username: user01
</I>&gt;<i> password: testfeed
</I>
I'll see if I can apply the patch and test around this afternoon. Maybe
you can comment on my comments to the patch above? I'd like to get your
input, as you're currently using a password-protected podcasts.

&gt;<i> Also, I fixed a little bug that would cause gPodder to freeze when loading a 
</I>&gt;<i> cover file with 0 length.
</I>
Great :) I'm really happy to see this work being done, and I think the
whole patch is a great addition to gPodder, so I think the 0.9.4 release
is gonna be a really cool thing now! I'd be happy to have you in the
gPodder team, if you want.


Thanks,
Thomas
