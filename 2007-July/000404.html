<PRE>Hi Thomas,

Attached is the patch with a few modifications, and I'll answer your 
questions/concerns inline.

</I>&gt;<i> not use strip() for the password field, hm?
</I>
Yeah, I guess I overlooked that one :s  
To test, I've added user02 with password &quot;test 1&quot; to the 
<A HREF="http://nikosapi.org/test_protected_feed/shows">http://nikosapi.org/test_protected_feed/shows</A> access list.

&gt;<i> &gt; Attached is a patch against svn revision 351 to add the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download podcasts from password protected server directories. It stores
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the username and password in the index.xml files in each local podcast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory. The passwords are obfuscated using a simple mapping table and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string.translate function. I know this isn't secure but I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's advisable to store the passwords in plaintext either. The username
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and password are set via the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab in the &quot;Edit channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information&quot; dialogue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see your point, but the password is passed as plain-text argument to
</I>&gt;<i> wget, so for the time of the download, it will be visible in the &quot;ps&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> list in plain text. string.translate as I see it in the patch also makes
</I>&gt;<i> the available characters only be from the ASCII charset, UTF-8 would be
</I>&gt;<i> so much better.
</I>
Although yes, you are right that the password is viewable via the ps command 
(I think that is even documented in the wget man page) I think it's just 
safer to keep the password as safe as possible in the event that someone is 
actually trying to find it. Although this still isn't very safe, it's still 
better than storing it in plaintext.

I tried to find out how to get the unicode.translate function to work but I 
couldn't figure it out. Now if you use a unicode password it will work but 
sadly it'll be stored in plaintext. I did find hints on how to possibly 
implement this here: <A HREF="http://www.dbforums.com/showthread.php?t=1419217">http://www.dbforums.com/showthread.php?t=1419217</A> but I 
couldn't figure it out :-(

Another idea would be to use somekind of symmetric encryption module that 
comes with python but I think that might be a bit excessive.

To test this using my test feed the username is user03 and the password 
is &quot;c'est l'&#233;t&#233;&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you would like to test it, I set up a feed and password protected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory on my server (with a 5 second &quot;podcast&quot; I made). Here's the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info for that: feed url: <A HREF="http://nikosapi.org/test_protected_feed/feed.xml">http://nikosapi.org/test_protected_feed/feed.xml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; username: user01
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; password: testfeed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll see if I can apply the patch and test around this afternoon. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> you can comment on my comments to the patch above? I'd like to get your
</I>&gt;<i> input, as you're currently using a password-protected podcasts.
</I>
I saw your email that contained the new and improved patch, that autodetection 
feature is pretty sweet. There was one small fix I made for handling of 
url-encoded characters (eg. %40 = @, etc.) in the feed url.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I fixed a little bug that would cause gPodder to freeze when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loading a cover file with 0 length.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great :) I'm really happy to see this work being done, and I think the
</I>&gt;<i> whole patch is a great addition to gPodder, so I think the 0.9.4 release
</I>&gt;<i> is gonna be a really cool thing now! I'd be happy to have you in the
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder team, if you want.
</I>
I wish I had more time to play with gPodder, I have a few more ideas that I'll 
try to implement by the end of the summer. 

If by &quot;gPodder team&quot; you mean svn access, I'm fine just passing patches back 
and forth on list. I mean I wouldn't commit anything without asking you first 
but if you'd like, email me offlist to tell me what that's all about.

&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
</I>
Thanks to you man!
