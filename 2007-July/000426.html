I've fixed it in the package source. The change will be available in the
next .deb upload. I'm not going to upload a new release just because of
this small annoyance, though :)

&gt;<i> &gt; My iPod is a rather old iPod mini, so I don't use the cover sync feature

</I>
Oh yeah, donations are always welcome ;) On the other hand, as long as
you're able to test and send in patches for newer iPod support, that's
not a big deal. You just have to tell me the features that are essential
for newer iPod users in relation to podcast metadata and send in patches
that add the functionality.

You patch is applied in svn trunk head now.


Enjoy,
Thomas
