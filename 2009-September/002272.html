&gt;<i> Is it just me or are the the advanced settings gone? I'm using version 2.0.
</I>
Yep, the are hidden. Use this key combination in the preferences
dialog for now:

Fullscreen-Fullscreen-Plus-Minus-Plus-Fullscreen

After heavy protests from users on talk.maemo.org, the &quot;Advanced&quot;
settings button is coming back in one of the next versions ;)

&gt;<i> Also, Just out of curiosity, is finger-scroll gone?
</I>
You can set the advanced configuration option &quot;enable_fingerscroll&quot;
to True, but it's not really supported anymore (makes the UI sluggish
and might even be broken right now).

&gt;<i> I think 2.0 is snappier, is this possible? That's cool! :)
</I>
At least I tried my best to make it feel snappier =)

Have fun,
Thomas
