Actually, it does appear, but deleted episodes are hidden by default.
I think the &quot;view&quot; menu should be made more discoverable, as I had
another user having the same problem:

<A HREF="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=328399&amp;postcount=343">http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=328399&amp;postcount=343</A>

So, in short, &quot;View&quot; -&gt; &quot;Show deleted episodes&quot; will un-hide (&quot;show&quot;)
the deleted episodes and display them with their trash can icons.

The same is true for the Desktop version, as well.
