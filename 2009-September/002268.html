<PRE>I've been using the 2.0 version of gpodder on Maemo and noticed that
the trash can doesn't appear next to a deleted episode anymore. Is it
possible to re-enable that? I used it to know which episode to
download next but now I don't know which ones I listened and which
ones I didn't.
Thanks! Cheers,
Silvio
