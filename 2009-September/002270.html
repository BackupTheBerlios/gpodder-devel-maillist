<PRE>&gt;<i> So, in short, &quot;View&quot; -&gt; &quot;Show deleted episodes&quot; will un-hide (&quot;show&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> the deleted episodes and display them with their trash can icons.
</I>
Sorry for that. I should have checked some more. I've been very active
in school and haven't had a lot of time lately. I should also read the
changelog and I still have the Spanish translation in my to do list.

</PRE>
