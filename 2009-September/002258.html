The notifications used are still the standard ones on non-Ubuntu systems
(or if you kill notify-osd and start notification-daemon). As Ubuntu's
notify-osd does not attach notifications to widgets, it's useless for
some notifications (i.e. press Ctrl+S when no device is configured).

It's nice to be able to &quot;hint&quot; which button to press when there is an
error. This is currently not possible with notify-osd (which is sad!).

That's why I decided to do these custom notification pop-ups on Ubuntu
when notify-osd is active. I agree that they look ugly, and I'm happily
accepting patches (NotificationWindow in src/gpodder/gtkui/widgets.py).

Also, it seems like notify-osd-based notifications can only fit limited
amount of text (at least less than notification-daemon).

I think it's a good idea that they are thinking about ways of making
the notifications system better, but as their changes seem to be more
radical, they (Canonical) should have left notification-daemon alone
and create something new (which developers can then start using) instead
of replacing notification-daemon and changing behaviour.

Also, last time I checked, notify-osd was closed source.. argh!

Maybe a &quot;Conflicts: notify-osd&quot; in the next Ubuntu package could solve
this problem? ;)

The notify-osd detection is in src/gpodder/gtkui/interface/common.py.
You can comment it there and try using Ubuntu's notifications.

Suggestions (and patches) as always welcome :)

Thomas
