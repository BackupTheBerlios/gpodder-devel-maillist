Can you please tell me which version of the gnome-icon-theme (or
hicolor-icon-theme) you are using? Could it be that you're using an
older version? Have you found out about a specific podcast channel for
which this happens, or can you export your complete podcast list as OPML
file and post it here, so I can try it out and see if it works for me?


Thanks,
Thomas
