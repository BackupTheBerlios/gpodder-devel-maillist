<PRE>Hello, Katy!

This workaround shouldn't be needed after a &quot;svn up&quot;, as I've added the
necessary code and sanity checks to the current SVN version thanks to
Richard Voigt's patch and bug reporting. If gPodder chokes after the
&quot;svn up&quot;, simply checkout the svn repository again and it should work.

Tell me if there still is a problem or if the problem is fixed now.

</I>
There should be no need for the cover deleting workaround anymore, but
feel free to post the PHP script anyway for its original purpose :)

</I>&gt;<i> hopefully i'll be able to contribute that soon. 
</I>
If you want to contribute to gPodder, it would be really good if you
write your code in Python. php-gtk2 is not as widely supported as PyGTK,
and in my personal opinion, PHP isn't well suited for desktop
applications (after all, it was written for web applications in the
first place). Hell, I even switched from PHP (~5 years non-OO PHP
experience) to Python for my web page after one and a half year
programming in Python, because Python seems so much better ;)

But not let the language choice stop you from contributing to gPodder -
see it as a good reason to learn Python.

And if you still want to write in php-gtk2, that's no problem, but your
tool might just not be included in the default gPodder distribution.


Thanks,
Thomas
