<PRE>This program is nearly perfect for me!  I'm so glad to see someone is still
focusing on audio for an aggregator.

The feature that is missing for me is a way to arrange my podcasts so that
they will transfer to my iAudio in chronological order--from oldest to
newest (now they load from newest to oldest).

The way it is now causes problems with my iAudio player because I can
arrange by file_name and download date, but can't reverse the order.  I
listen to the Adam Carolla Show which releases ~12 segments a day.  If I
load them with gPodder and just let it go I would be listening to the
segments in reverse order starting with the end of the show.

I can get around this by renaming all of the files but I was hoping there
could be a way for gpodder to handle this.  Maybe if you could sort by the
&quot;released&quot; column, reverse the order by clicking on that header and that
would affect the order the files get loaded onto the device my problem could
be solved.  Even if you just allow people to sort like that it would be nice
if people want to listen to something in order on their computer.  Another
way to get around this would be to have a feature that could append numbers
to the front of the file name.  I'm not sure how that would work.  Maybe
there would be an even better way to do this if my player would read ide3
tags--it doesn't.

Just wanted to give my input!  I'm an amature programmer so if I can ever
sit down and figure out how to do what I want I'll let you know.
