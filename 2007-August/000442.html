When you're using rockbox, I assume you're using the FS-based sync
method. You can delete all downloaded episodes from gPodder once synced,
and they will not be deleted from your FS-based MP3 player. Newly-added
episodes will still be added to your MP3 player.

The thing gets complicated if you want to keep episodes in gPodder, too.

&gt;<i> I'd rather not have to manually maintain a list of podcasts to delete

</I>
What is planned to be implemented is the one-way sync: In the future,
gPodder will detect episodes deleted in gPodder and delete the episodes
on the iPod or FS-based MP3 player, too.

It would be hard to detect if a podcast has been deleted from an MP3
player or if it's just a newly downloaded episodes. If we wanted to do
this, we'd have to keep track of which episodes have been synchronized
already.

How would you be using the mentioned features, or: would these features
satisfy your needs?


Thanks,
Thomas
