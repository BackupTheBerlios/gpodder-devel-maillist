<PRE>lol,

       i was to slow to reply as per usual.  i'm super glad that its 
been fixed dblly so since it'll save me from having to add a gd layer to 
my script just to check for image validity, w00t.  i'll be sure to 
update my svn revision and re-compile.  and yeah i'll def still post my 
script for my original need.  and though i'm def a php fan girl(i've 
even been playing with php 6 and its way nice.  but yeah if i were gonna 
contribute to gPodder i'd def try python, though being far more of a 
designer &amp;artist/coder &amp;haker than an engineer i'll never be a huge fan 
of python, i'd rather design in C/C++ if i need a migrian(*wink* jokie), 
than python.  but i just find php more fun &amp;i guess that why i use it 
the most, i enjoy writing it more, web or not.  but language zelousy 
aside *wink*, of course once i'm able to contribute 'to' gPodder i'd 
write anything in python(which i do know, just not like, *ick*).  if i 
can't manage to write stuff in python 'to' gPodder than yeah i'd still 
write 'for' gPodder but than i'd expect it not to be part of gPodder's 
trunk.  but thnx again for your work on an awesome podcatcher &amp;a 
wonderful community that doesn't try and kill communication for the sake 
of efficiency i really appreciate it.  i'm sorry i was so slow in 
replying though, but i do hope to contribute in the future.  &amp;i'll post 
my php script straight away, after i clean up my pseudo fix since i 
don't need to keep it in there.  &amp;thnx again.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This workaround shouldn't be needed after a &quot;svn up&quot;, as I've added the

</I>&gt;<i> Tell me if there still is a problem or if the problem is fixed now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my php script, which i'll post in the next couple of days(under its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own thread of course), automatically checks all the 'cover' files and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deletes the ones that aren't valid images-i'm gonna use the gd or

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the gd library since its the one i'm most familiar with &amp;it has the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lowest overhead.  lol, and just to mention it, my php progie/script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still relies on gPodder &amp;php's cli/cgi.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There should be no need for the cover deleting workaround anymore, but
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to post the PHP script anyway for its original purpose :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...] and though i love gPodder and _will_ abs help work on it in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future(if you want it that is) all my work with gPodder *wink* has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only confirm my dislike of python.  i may just have ti write my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> podcatcher in php-gtk2(joking, mostly), i'd actually love to help with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gPodder - like in my free time i'm writing a play list manager for it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hopefully i'll be able to contribute that soon. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to contribute to gPodder, it would be really good if you
</I>&gt;<i> write your code in Python. php-gtk2 is not as widely supported as PyGTK,
</I>&gt;<i> and in my personal opinion, PHP isn't well suited for desktop
</I>&gt;<i> applications (after all, it was written for web applications in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place). Hell, I even switched from PHP (~5 years non-OO PHP
</I>&gt;<i> experience) to Python for my web page after one and a half year
</I>&gt;<i> programming in Python, because Python seems so much better ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But not let the language choice stop you from contributing to gPodder -
</I>&gt;<i> see it as a good reason to learn Python.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And if you still want to write in php-gtk2, that's no problem, but your
</I>&gt;<i> tool might just not be included in the default gPodder distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
