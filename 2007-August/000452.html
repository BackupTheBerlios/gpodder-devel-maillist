<PRE>*hopes this threads correctly*,
         okay, please no lectures on html/css/etc &amp;mailman, yes i know.  
i had believed i had deleted my stationary for my email on the whole, 
but it only deleted my html and left my css.  i'm just proactivily 
warding off any lectures about mailing list format etiguette, my bad.  
now here's my origanal message, minus my css boo-boo.

        i had i've just joined this list so i can't actually reply to 
any part of the thread. but i'm having this issue as well. i have 
however narrowed down exactly when it occurs. it happens once i 
subscribe to more than 55 podcasts; its then that gPodder will stop 
loading subscribed podcasts, both in the drop down &amp;left hand side 
navigation. i went through my channels.xml commenting out groups of 
podcasts until it failed to load. it never did generate an error while 
loading. however i did get it to generate the following error when i 
switched to gPodder's `Download Status` tab and then back to its 
`Podcasts` tab:

        ** (gpodder:6758): CRITICAL **: clearlooks_style_draw_focus: 
assertion `height &gt;= -1' failed

        i hope this helps. thnx again for all your work on gPodder and 
if i had even a moment to spare i'd dive right in to gPodder's 
code(though i may in the future)... but i don't even have the time to 
send this email. lol, well thnx again &amp;advance.

</PRE>
