<PRE>Hello, Richard!

Included are some explanations, hints and things you can try out to get
gPodder 0.9.4 running. As you're using a Gentoo ebuild, it might be
related to this, bug it might as well be a yet-undetected bug in the
current codebase.

Please try renaming/removing your ~/.config/gpodder/ directory and/or
try the latest SVN trunk version. If the problem still persists, please
also provide debugging output you can get by using &quot;gpodder --verbose&quot;.

&gt;<i> Since upgrading to 0.9.4, gpodder is pretty much useless for me.  It's

</I>
It works fine for many people, and the functional and bug-fixing
improvements are worth an upgrade, for sure :)

&gt;<i> Basically, it still knows about my subscribed feeds and still
</I>&gt;<i> downloads new episodes using the check for new... download all new...
</I>&gt;<i> functions.  But, the dropdown of channels is empty, so I can't see or
</I>&gt;<i> play what I've downloaded. 
</I>
I've tried subscribing to all your channels from the OPML you sent,
starting out with a &quot;fresh&quot; gPodder directory (rename or remove your
~/.config/gpodder/ folder), and it works for me, have a look:

<A HREF="http://spock.thpinfo.com/~thp/images/gpodder-richard-voigt.png">http://spock.thpinfo.com/~thp/images/gpodder-richard-voigt.png</A>

&gt;<i> I tried renaming my channels.xml file and readding the channels, it
</I>&gt;<i> just tells me I already have the latest episodes and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> displays the list from one channel, but the channel dropdown is still
</I>&gt;<i> empty, and after restarting the program the screen is blank again.  I
</I>&gt;<i> also tried renaming the cache directory -- no improvement. 
</I>
Please run gPodder with the &quot;--verbose&quot; command in a terminal window and
mail the output of gPodder's verbose mode (debugging output, etc..).

&gt;<i> Maybe the feeds I'm subscribed to don't have cover art.  Could that
</I>&gt;<i> confuse gpodder?  I've attached the feed list which gpodder exported
</I>&gt;<i> -- it clearly still has all the feed information.
</I>
I'm using feeds without cover art myself, and I'm sure many users are
subscribed to some feeds without cover art.

&gt;<i> If there's any more information I can supply, please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> This is gentoo linux, 64-bit on a core 2 duo, installed using the
</I>&gt;<i> ebuild. 
</I>
Please try out the latest SVN release of gPodder. gPodder has a build
infrastructure that enables you to run the SVN version of gPodder from a
local directory without the need to install it into system directories,
and it doesn't interfere with installed gPodder versions (in fact, these
are ignored ;).

Here's how you can try out the latest SVN version:

$ svn co <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk</A> gpodder
$ cd gpodder
$ make test

This checks out the latest source code, changes into the source tree,
and runs the local version of gPodder with verbosity turned on.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the (previously) great software! 
</I>
I hope we can help you get it running for you again, as gPodder 0.9.4 is
really one of our shiniest releases today, and it really works well for
many users :) Although, if there IS a bug in gPodder which you've just
spotted, I'd be very glad if you could help us investigate and get rid
of that bug, as it might happen to someone else, too.


Thanks,
Thomas
