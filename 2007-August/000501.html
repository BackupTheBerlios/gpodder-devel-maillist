<PRE>Hi again!

When I download multiple episodes from the same channel, most of them ends up 
as the same mp3 file, but with correct titles/headings.  It's not likely that 
this problem is caused by the channel.  It's the most importent radiostation 
in Norway.  If its caused by the station, you should also get the same 
problem.  You can try subscribing to 
<A HREF="http://podkast.nrk.no/program/saann_er_livet.rss">http://podkast.nrk.no/program/saann_er_livet.rss</A> for example.

I've running gpodder 0.9.4, installed from the newest Fedora 7 rpm.

I've tried to remove all gpodder related files from the users homedirectory, 
before I removed the package (because it whas an upgraded version) and 
reinstalled it again.  All other Fedora packages are the newest.

A bug?

Best regards!

</PRE>
