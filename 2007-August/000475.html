<PRE>Hello, Wilfred!

Late here, read with care ;)

Another buggy RSS feed, it seems - yay!

</I>
Seems obvious. The only unique string I can derive on a per-episode
basis from _every_ RSS podcast is a hash of the URL. This makes the file
names unreadable in standard directory browsers (that's how gPodder
stores the episodes in its download directory, btw).

&gt;<i> I took a look in the file ipodsync.py and noticed that
</I>&gt;<i> indeed the name 'to_file' is derived from the
</I>&gt;<i> 'episode'-info. But there is no exception for an empty
</I>&gt;<i> episode-field.
</I>
Should I make an exception for empty episodes that would fill in the md5
hash of the URL of the episode? It would not be very readable, but at
least it would sync correctly.

&gt;<i> So could it be possible to make something in this case
</I>&gt;<i> that yields a file name derived from the channel name,
</I>&gt;<i> with a counter attached so that the old files are not
</I>&gt;<i> overwritten when the new ones are sync'd? Something
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> to_file = ${channel_name}_1.${extension}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if( to_file exists on iPod ) then
</I>&gt;<i>   while( to_file exists on iPod )
</I>&gt;<i>     i++
</I>&gt;<i>     to_file = $channel_name_$i.${extension}
</I>&gt;<i>   end
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it should be relatively easy, but I have no
</I>&gt;<i> experience programming Python. 
</I>
Won't work, because after every sync, the files would be duplicated, as
there is no way to check if an episode has already been synced or not
(except when comparing file contents, which is expensive).

Would a file name like &quot;76ab760dc7b607607a60d8767cada0687c6ad&quot; be okay
for you? This would be relatively easy to implement.

To be honest, this is a bug that the RSS feed author should fix (I mean,
empty episode titles...HELLO?!), but if we find a nice, hack-ish
workaround, I might be ready to commit it to our codebase :)


Thanks,
Thomas
