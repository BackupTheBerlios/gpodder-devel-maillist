<PRE>Hello, Katy!

I've tried importing it, but I'm still on 64k and downloading all RSS
feeds is a bit slow here. Also, I think that gPodder could be made
faster by optimizing feed loading/localdb access. I think having so many
subscriptions is unusual, but I gladly accept performance-increasing
patches (make localdb access on-demand and not on startup, etc..).

&gt;<i> it doesn't happen on any specific one of my podcasts, just number 55. 
</I>
Which RSS URL does your podcast number 55 have? Or do you mean that any
podcast which happens to be on position 55 produces the problem?

&gt;<i> i've mixed and matched which podcasts it has in channels.xml.  no
</I>&gt;<i> matter what i comment out or don't it gets to 56 and than it won't
</I>&gt;<i> display the podcasts.
</I>
Can you please provide the output of running &quot;gpodder --verbose&quot; and
trying to reproduce your problem?

&gt;<i> as a note gpodder work for --list, --add, --delete, --run, and
</I>&gt;<i> everything even with all of my podcasts subscribed
</I>
Does this mean you can get more than 55 feeds on the CLI but not in the
GUI? Seems strange to me, although I know that the CLI is more
straightforward than the GUI (it simply reads in some data and processes
the command line switches, no sophisticated caching/downloading/parsing
necessary).

&gt;<i> so i'm using gpodder from the terminal  &amp;i'm writing a php shell
</I>&gt;<i> script (please no flames) that creates readable symlinks to my
</I>&gt;<i> podcasts so i can navigate things easier &amp;i can post that for anyone
</I>&gt;<i> who wants it, once i feel better &amp;i'm done with it.
</I>
Yeah, send it in, maybe it's useful for somebody. Or we might convert it
to Python and include it in gPodder's standard distribution as an
additional way of providing a browseable download directory.

&gt;<i> i am using the most up date version of gnome, and hi color &amp;icon
</I>&gt;<i> theme, its all part of my distro's latest packages(i'm using opensuse
</I>&gt;<i> 10.3).  i'm actually using a custom svg icon theme( the Lila theme
</I>&gt;<i> from <A HREF="http://art.gnome.org/">http://art.gnome.org/</A> ), but even with just using the default
</I>&gt;<i> icon theme, or high color, gPodder has the same issues.
</I>
Please try out the latest SVN version, instructions on how to check out
the svn trunk head can be found on the gPodder website or on the mailing
list. You can run the SVN version without installing gPodder by using
&quot;make test&quot;.

&gt;<i> i hope you have some luck with this, i'm lost... right now i think i'm
</I>&gt;<i> gonna go back to sleep now ;-).  if you need anything let me know and
</I>&gt;<i> i'll get back as soon as i'm able.  thank you again for your work on
</I>&gt;<i> this project *you rock*. 
</I>
It would be very helpful if you could provide the console output of both
the installed version of gPodder and the SVN version so we can
investigate what could have went wrong. With the installed version, you
have to pass &quot;--verbose&quot; as command line argument, for the development
version, &quot;make test&quot; will automatically enable verbose output.


Thanks,
Thomas
