<PRE>*hugs again Thomas*,

       i've finally finished my php script, my morning-so a few hours 
ago.  i also tried running --verbose and hmmm... huh?  gpodder loaded 
fine.  huh?  one lil note, is that while i was writing my php script i'd 
delete all of the podcasts 'cover' files and all of my 102 podcasts 
showed up?  so i started getting podcast's cover image/album art and 
when i got to my subscription to an Australian Non-profit podcast (their 
feed url is <A HREF="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Cpns-qut-nonprofitPodcasts">http://feeds.feedburner.com/Cpns-qut-nonprofitPodcasts</A> )  i 
found several other of my podcasts that this would happen with.  than 
when gpodder tries to download any podcast's cover art gpodder would 
download an html, xml, or other document.  i've attached the html 
document that gpodder ended up downloading; for the Australian 
non-profit podcast.  quiting gpodder, removing that podcasts 'cover' 
file, &amp;than restarting gpodder fixes the problem.

        so anyone who's having this problem, here's a work around until 
there's a perm fix.  you'll need to delete all of your podcasts' 'cover' 
files which aren't images, unless you know which podcast specifically is 
causing your problem.  my php script, which i'll post in the next couple 
of days(under its own thread of course), automatically checks all the 
'cover' files and deletes the ones that aren't valid images-i'm gonna 
use the gd or ImageMagick php extensions to check each file.  most 
likely i'll use the gd library since its the one i'm most familiar with 
&amp;it has the lowest overhead.  lol, and just to mention it, my php 
progie/script still relies on gPodder &amp;php's cli/cgi.

        back on topic; my script has a command line option that just 
hast it fix each podcast's 'cover' art/image.   and than gpodder can be 
restarted and things will work fine.  just make sure not to try and 
download those podcasts cover art again.  which happens automatically 
when you select 'Podcast' -&gt; 'Edit ...(podcast's name)'.  everyone can 
be doubly safe by running gpodder from a terminal window and watching 
their terminal for the error message(which i've listed at the end of my 
message.

       than Thomas, thnx again for helping me with this issue.  i'm 
sorry that we've spent so much time chasing it around blindly, only to 
find that the issue was something else entirely.  though i'm glad that 
we're close to fixing it.  and though i love gPodder and _will_ abs help 
work on it in the future(if you want it that is) all my work with 
gPodder *wink* has only confirm my dislike of python.  i may just have 
ti write my own podcatcher in php-gtk2(joking, mostly), i'd actually 
love to help with gPodder - like in my free time i'm writing a play list 
manager for it.  hopefully i'll be able to contribute that soon.  lately 
though- ^_^' *blush* -i've literally been spending almost all of my time 
writing my php progie, which i'm super happy with, and now combined with 
gpodder i'm actually super happy with linux podcathing.  i actually 
don't even miss miro(yeah *ick* i know) but until now it was the best 
option i had.

        now i just _must_ get audacity running again, i'll switch 
distros if i have to.  because audacity is something i truly can't move 
on without.  that and x.org 7.3 is abs necessary, i need its vesa/video 
card display modes fix.  okay, lol, i'm done with my off topic 
babbling.  so to close, here's the error that gPodder generates when it 
downloads an invalid cover art.  i'm sure all that needs to be done is 
that this exception needs caught and to than delete the 'cover' file.  
anyway, i hope my babbling make sense &amp;help.  thnx again Thomas &amp;i hope 
that i get to help with gpodder.  *hugs*

Exception in thread Thread-3:

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, send it in, maybe it's useful for somebody. Or we might convert it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i am using the most up date version of gnome, and hi color &amp;icon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theme, its all part of my distro's latest packages(i'm using opensuse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10.3).  i'm actually using a custom svg icon theme( the Lila theme
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from <A HREF="http://art.gnome.org/">http://art.gnome.org/</A> ), but even with just using the default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> icon theme, or high color, gPodder has the same issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please try out the latest SVN version, instructions on how to check out
</I>&gt;<i> the svn trunk head can be found on the gPodder website or on the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list. You can run the SVN version without installing gPodder by using
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make test&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i hope you have some luck with this, i'm lost... right now i think i'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gonna go back to sleep now ;-).  if you need anything let me know and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i'll get back as soon as i'm able.  thank you again for your work on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this project *you rock*. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be very helpful if you could provide the console output of both
</I>&gt;<i> the installed version of gPodder and the SVN version so we can
</I>&gt;<i> investigate what could have went wrong. With the installed version, you
</I>&gt;<i> have to pass &quot;--verbose&quot; as command line argument, for the development
</I>&gt;<i> version, &quot;make test&quot; will automatically enable verbose output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
