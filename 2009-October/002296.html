<PRE>Hi,

I'm liking the ability to automatically set played status on my
podcasts based on the scrobble log that Rockbox so helpfully generates
when playing things. However the operation is currently less than
ideal.

The main problem is that the scrobbling device only really has a view
of the metadata tags in the file itself which is often less than
unique. gPodder however uses metadata gleaned from the RSS feeds which
may well not match that of the metadata tags. In fact as far as I can
make out the only time tag meta data is read is to gather length
information.

So there are two possible approaches I can think of to make the
handling better:

1. Re-tag the file when copied onto the device (maybe hi-jacking the
album position field?) with a unique ID we can the look up.

2. Expose the tag meta-data in the gPodder API (so ogg/mp3 difference
can be hidden) and use that to match scrobble log-&gt;podcast

I posted a patch earlier this month that slightly improves the
situation but no one has given me feedback on it. Any comments? I
would appreciate any feedback.
