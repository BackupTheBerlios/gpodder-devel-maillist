<PRE>Hello, Alex!

You wrote:
&gt;<i> I'm liking the ability to automatically set played status on my
</I>&gt;<i> podcasts based on the scrobble log that Rockbox so helpfully generates
</I>&gt;<i> when playing things. However the operation is currently less than
</I>&gt;<i> ideal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main problem is that the scrobbling device only really has a view
</I>&gt;<i> of the metadata tags in the file itself which is often less than
</I>&gt;<i> unique. gPodder however uses metadata gleaned from the RSS feeds which
</I>&gt;<i> may well not match that of the metadata tags. In fact as far as I can
</I>&gt;<i> make out the only time tag meta data is read is to gather length
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So there are two possible approaches I can think of to make the
</I>&gt;<i> handling better:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Re-tag the file when copied onto the device (maybe hi-jacking the
</I>&gt;<i> album position field?) with a unique ID we can the look up.
</I>
That's what the following bug is about:

<A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533</A>

I'd appreciate it if you could jump in and help implementing a proper
metadata module for gPodder that can be used to update tags for all
different kinds of audio and video files (configurable via gPodder's
settings).

&gt;<i> 2. Expose the tag meta-data in the gPodder API (so ogg/mp3 difference
</I>&gt;<i> can be hidden) and use that to match scrobble log-&gt;podcast
</I>
That's probably also something that could be added to the metadata
module in gPodder, so that you can read back the metadata and compare
it with the metadata of the specific episode.

&gt;<i> I posted a patch earlier this month that slightly improves the
</I>&gt;<i> situation but no one has given me feedback on it. Any comments? I
</I>&gt;<i> would appreciate any feedback.
</I>
Have you posted the patch as bug on bugs.gpodder.org? If so, please
tell me the bug ID, and I will have a look at it. If not, please
submit the patch as a new bug there.

Thanks,
Thomas
