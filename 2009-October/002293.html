<PRE>Hello. Good work with Gpodder.

I am interested in adding support for multiple devices. As I have
thought about how to implement it,
I have come up with a few questions. My theoretical implementation
looks something like this:
Take the current device specific options, and apply them to individual
devices, such that each device
(kept track of by a UID or something) has multiple attributes,
including name, type, type-specific options,
album art related stuff, and whatnot. Various presets could be used to
ease the user's selection.

In addition to this, whether or not each feed should be synced to a
give device should be user configurable.
Other feed-specific options are (IMO) beyond the scope of what I'm
looking to accomplish.

This leads me to my questions.
How do I add config options?
Should I surface them in the basic prefs editor?
If so, how do I do that?

Any other tips/advice would be appreciated. If I've totally got the
wrong idea or
something, let me know. I've scoured the git tree as well as searching
the wiki, but I
might have missed something, in which case please kindly point me to
the right place.

Thanks,
Hilton
