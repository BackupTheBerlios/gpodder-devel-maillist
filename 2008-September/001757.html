You can click in the episode list on the episode and chose to not ask
for it to be downloaded again. This will probably fix your problem.

As to adding the info to the list, I don't know - wouldn't that make
some users unaware that some error happened, because it only appear in
the downloads tab? From what I learned from the User Test in May this
year, some users even had problems realizing that there was a
&quot;Downloads&quot; tab there, because theoretically, you don't have to know
about it right now - you can show the progress in the episode dialog
window, too.

Of course, this function would be nice for re-starting downloads. Maybe
have the message box but also keep the episode in the downloads list in
that case? What do you think?
