Version 3.5.2 of Glade (to be found in Debian experimental) seems to
have support for GtkBuilder (at least you can set it in the
preferences), so a future migration might not be that difficult if
we just stick to using Glade.

</I>
It would be nice to have proper support for the Glade editor,
though. I would like to make some GUI improvements or least play
around with it a bit, but I don't want to mess around with the XML
file itself since I'm not very used to Gtk yet. Just opening and
resaving the file with Glade seems to break some things now.
