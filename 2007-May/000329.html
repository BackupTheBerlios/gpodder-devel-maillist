<PRE>Hello

&gt;&gt;<i> I tried to change the default download directory ~/gpodder-downloads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to /media/share/podcasts on a vfat drive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If moving the download folder doesn't work for you, it might be related
</I>&gt;<i> to not having enough space left on the destination device or some other
</I>&gt;<i> permissions problem. You can always move the folder manually:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Close gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Move the download directory to the new destination
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Change the &quot;download_dir&quot; setting in ~/.config/gpodder/gpodder.conf
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Restart gPodder
</I>Yes, this worked well. I don't know why it wasn't able to change this 
via the GUI.

&gt;&gt;<i> * How do I import a local OPML file with my Podcast list from my web 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aggregator?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Enter the web location of your OPML file in the preferences dialog and
</I>&gt;<i> click on &quot;Podcasts&quot; -&gt; &quot;Channel list&quot; -&gt; &quot;Import from web&quot;. Then, add
</I>&gt;<i> the channels you want to add to your gPodder channel list.
</I>Ah, now I got it.
I'd thought that the feeds presented there were somehow predefined...

&gt;<i> Currently not, but this item is on the TODO list, which means it will
</I>&gt;<i> get into gPodder when somebody finds the time to implement this feature.
</I>I don't know Python (yet) so I cannot help.
Where can I find the to do list?
Shall I file a bugreport for my wishes or improvement ideas?



&gt;<i> I don't have the time to implement this feature currently, and I am also
</I>&gt;<i> not totally sure how to best implement this feature so that it will be
</I>&gt;<i> easy to use without having to configure many things.
</I>At least we are on linux. We could use a
call like
find $download_dir -ctime 7 |xargs /bin/rm -f


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Combined with this feature is also a &quot;delete locally-deleted podcasts on
</I>&gt;<i> the iPod/MP3 player&quot; feature wishlist item, which would also help in
</I>&gt;<i> keeping the portable player clean.
</I>looks as if this could be solved with rsync or unison.

Here are some more ideas/suggestions:

* I would like to have playlists build automatically or a third tab 
where gPodder presents the user with all un-listended Podcast. I have 
some 30 feeds on the list so it would be easier than checking ervy 
singel feed for downloads.
* gPodder selects the last 3 episodes of a new feed for download. Can 
this be changed to only the laste one?

Anywany for playing unlistened podcasts rythmbox has better capabilities 
since it supports dynaimc playlists. But gPodder's feed control is much 
better. A integration of both would be nice.

One again, thanks for putting this program into the wild!

Tim.
