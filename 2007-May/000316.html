<PRE>Hello!

I've just released gPodder 0.9.2, here's the original announcement:

==============================
This month, gPodder celebrates its 2nd birthday - rejoice! We've been
busy preparing yet another great release of your favourite Podcast
catcher. Since the last release, gPodder has been packaged officially
for Debian GNU/Linux and it's already available in Ubuntu's universe
repository, too.

This release adds support for podcasts using the BitTorrent protocol to
carry the actual content. Support is provided by either invoking
gnome-bittorrent or by giving the .torrent files to your favourite
BitTorrent client (e.g. Azureus). Bandwidth limiting (rate limits,
queue) is also provided for users on dial-up and low-bandwidth
connections. And last but not least, gPodder is now translated into
Russian! :)

You can download gPodder from the berlios download servers or wait for
your distribution to update the gPodder packages in their repositores.

Changes since gPodder 0.9.1

      * Handling of GUIDs: Where available, use GUIDs to better
        recognize already downloaded episodes
      * BitTorrent support: Download torrents using gnome-btdownload
        (other BT clients also supported)
      * Save episode as file: One-click saving of single episodes as
        audio/video file
      * Synchronization options: Only synchronize unplayed episodes to
        MP3 player/iPod
      * Bandwidth limiting: Specify maximum download rate on a
        per-epsiode basis
      * Download Queue: Specify maximum number of concurrent downloads
      * New preferences dialog: Better structure, cool layout!
      * Removed features: &quot;Link to download folder on Desktop&quot;
        preference
      * New translation: Russian (Vladimir Zemlyakov)
      * Updated translations: Dutch (Pieter De Decker), Portuguese (Joel
        Calado), German
      * The usual bugfixes: Mixed blog/podcast feeds work better now;
        escape markup in episode title


Thanks

      * Vladimir Zemlyakov translated gPodder into Russian
      * Pieter De Decker updated the Dutch translation
      * Joel Calado updated the Portuguese translation
      * Gerrit Sangel reported a bug and helped fixing it
      * Nick (nikosapi) did most of the BitTorrent code and the &quot;only
        sync unplayed episodes&quot; patch
      * Andy Busch for the donation

If you're using a distribution package, please file a bug in your
distribution's BTS or mail the packager and ask him/her to update the
package in the repositores. For Ubuntu Gutsy and Debian, I've already
prepared 0.9.2 packages and they will hopefully be uploaded soon to the
Debian Archives.

Thanks to all who made this release possible! :)


Enjoy,
Thomas
