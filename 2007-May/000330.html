<PRE>Hello, Tim!

Contributing to gPodder doesn't always involve coding only. A few  
possibilities are outlined here: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/">http://gpodder.berlios.de/</A> 
contribute.html

You can also do a totally voluntary donation, here are two links you  
might find helpful: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/donate.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/donate.html</A> and <A HREF="http://">http://</A> 
www.amazon.de/gp/registry/2PD2MYGHE6857

&gt;<i> Where can I find the to do list?
</I>
The current gPodder TODO list can always be found here:

<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk/TODO">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk/TODO</A>

&gt;<i> Shall I file a bugreport for my wishes or improvement ideas?
</I>
For wishlist items, you can send a mail to the gpodder-devel mailing  
list and I'll add it to the todo list if nobody else is doing it.

For real bugs, it's better to file a bugreport on gPodder's  
berlios.de project page and bug tracker: <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/">http://developer.berlios.de/</A> 
projects/gpodder, but many people find it easier to simply send the  
bug report to the gpodder-devel mailing list, which is also fine (but  
a bug may be overlooked for some time..).

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't have the time to implement this feature currently, and I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not totally sure how to best implement this feature so that it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy to use without having to configure many things.
</I>&gt;<i> At least we are on linux. We could use a
</I>&gt;<i> call like
</I>&gt;<i> find $download_dir -ctime 7 |xargs /bin/rm -f
</I>
gPodder doesn't only run on Linux, there is at least one active user  
I know of that uses some flavour of BSD. Also, gPodder keeps a local  
database of the downloaded podcasts' metadata, so just removing the  
downloaded files is not enough.

&gt;&gt;<i> Combined with this feature is also a &quot;delete locally-deleted  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> podcasts on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the iPod/MP3 player&quot; feature wishlist item, which would also help in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keeping the portable player clean.
</I>&gt;<i> looks as if this could be solved with rsync or unison.
</I>
Maybe this would work for filesystem-based MP3 players (but then  
again, gPodder's download directory structure isn't the same as the  
current &quot;synched&quot; format, which basically sorts files into folders  
and easily-readable file names.

And of course this method would not work at all for iPods, as we have  
to update the iTunesDB, etc..

&gt;<i> Here are some more ideas/suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I would like to have playlists build automatically or a third tab
</I>&gt;<i> where gPodder presents the user with all un-listended Podcast. I have
</I>&gt;<i> some 30 feeds on the list so it would be easier than checking ervy
</I>&gt;<i> singel feed for downloads.
</I>
What kind of interaction features would you wish from such a &quot;New  
Episodes&quot; tab? Also, will the episode disappear as soon as it is  
played the first time? It surely sounds like a nice idea, don't know  
how you would imagine it to look and act like to be useful. I'd also  
like to have input from other users here :)

&gt;<i> * gPodder selects the last 3 episodes of a new feed for download. Can
</I>&gt;<i> this be changed to only the laste one?
</I>
Currently not, but it would be trivial to implement if the desire is  
here. I just thought 3 is a good default and have not yet made it a  
preference, as I try to keep the user-configurable preferences down  
to a minimum (think &quot;ugh, Emacs&quot;).

&gt;<i> Anywany for playing unlistened podcasts rythmbox has better  
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities
</I>&gt;<i> since it supports dynaimc playlists. But gPodder's feed control is  
</I>&gt;<i> much
</I>&gt;<i> better. A integration of both would be nice.
</I>
Do you think a &quot;unplayed.m3u&quot; feature in gPodder (adding file names  
of unplayed items to a playlist file that Rhythmbox can read) would  
solve that problem?

Enjoy,
Thomas
