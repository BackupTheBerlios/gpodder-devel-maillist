<PRE>Hi,

With the attched patch libtagupdate won't write the genre tag if an
option called clear_genre_tag is true. I prevented writing the tag at
all in libtagupdate just to be sure. It might be enough to pass genre=''
in libpodcasts, but that way at least the ogg files would actually have
an empty genre tag, whereas with this patch there won't be one at all.

The reason I wrote this patch is that the Sandisk Sansa players'
firmware handles files tagged with &quot;podcast&quot; differently from any others
and I want to be able to prevent that.

Here are the bugs (or features) of the firmware's podcast tag handling
I'm trying to avoid:
 - If the album tags of the media files differ, you specifically have to
choose an album to play, you can't just select all the podcasts at once.
 - The files are played in such an order that the files which have a
&quot;higher alphanumeric order&quot; get played first. For example foocast2.ogg
is played before foocast1.ogg and I really don't like that, I want to
play the podcasts in the order they were recorded.
 - Both of these bugs can be avoided by using a playlist, but the device
won't show any files on the playlist which have been tagged with the
&quot;podcast&quot; genre, because the special podcast handling takes precedence.
This is why I'd like to be able to remove the genre tag altogether and
make a playlist with the gPodder device playlist feature so I can
control which files are played and in which order.

If needed, I could make a bug report about this patch and we could
discuss this more there, the mailing list is fine too. If you think this
patch isn't that useful in general, I could maintain it just for myself
as well.
