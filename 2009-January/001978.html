<PRE>You wrote:
&gt;<i> With the attched patch libtagupdate won't write the genre tag if an
</I>&gt;<i> option called clear_genre_tag is true. I prevented writing the tag at
</I>&gt;<i> all in libtagupdate just to be sure. It might be enough to pass genre=''
</I>&gt;<i> in libpodcasts, but that way at least the ogg files would actually have
</I>&gt;<i> an empty genre tag, whereas with this patch there won't be one at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I wrote this patch is that the Sandisk Sansa players'
</I>&gt;<i> firmware handles files tagged with &quot;podcast&quot; differently from any others
</I>&gt;<i> and I want to be able to prevent that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the bugs (or features) of the firmware's podcast tag handling
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to avoid:
</I>&gt;<i>  - If the album tags of the media files differ, you specifically have to
</I>&gt;<i> choose an album to play, you can't just select all the podcasts at once.
</I>&gt;<i>  - The files are played in such an order that the files which have a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;higher alphanumeric order&quot; get played first. For example foocast2.ogg
</I>&gt;<i> is played before foocast1.ogg and I really don't like that, I want to
</I>&gt;<i> play the podcasts in the order they were recorded.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Both of these bugs can be avoided by using a playlist, but the device
</I>&gt;<i> won't show any files on the playlist which have been tagged with the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;podcast&quot; genre, because the special podcast handling takes precedence.
</I>&gt;<i> This is why I'd like to be able to remove the genre tag altogether and
</I>&gt;<i> make a playlist with the gPodder device playlist feature so I can
</I>&gt;<i> control which files are played and in which order.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If needed, I could make a bug report about this patch and we could
</I>&gt;<i> discuss this more there, the mailing list is fine too. If you think this
</I>&gt;<i> patch isn't that useful in general, I could maintain it just for myself
</I>&gt;<i> as well.
</I>
Please open a bug report for this patch and attach it to the bug report.
I don't yet know what is the best way to achieve this (set no tag and
remove any existing tags if they exist or simply remove the tag).

Also, the configuration variable name probably has to be renamed to be a
bit more self-explanatory when being looked at without context.

More on that at the bug discussion page once created. Thanks for your
effort in making gPodder work perfectly with that specific MP3 player!
