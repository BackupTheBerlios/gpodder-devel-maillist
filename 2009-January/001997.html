<PRE>Hello there!

(If you are in a hurry, skip to the &quot;How you can help&quot; list below)

The last release has been one month and ten days ago, and we've done
some very impressive performance improvements and obvious bug fixes
during this time. Also, we've once again updated a few translations,
so that non-English speaking users also have access to gPodder's
functionality.

There have been a few Maemo-related UI improvements, as we now use
the mokoui finger scrolling widget on the Maemo UI. These patches
have been merged into the repository in the last few days.

This month is exam month at University, so the allotted time for
working on the project is obviously limited. This very likely moves
the release date for the next version of gPodder into February. If
you want to help with the release process, get in touch!

For us to have a very slick release in February, you can help:

 * Make sure your patches have been merged already, if not, please
   reply on the bug tracker and bring forgotten patches to my attention
 * &quot;git pull&quot; from the master branch (see wiki.gpodder.org for infos)
   and test the current development version, so we can spot any bugs
   in the next few weeks and fix them before the release
 * Make sure the translations are up to date
 * Browse the bug tracker at bugs.gpodder.org and see if you can help
   to reproduce bugs, provide more information or even write a patch!
 * Hang around in #gpodder on FreeNode and help out users who drop in
   and need your help - we want to shine at user support, too ;)

Also, what do you think of adding a forum in addition to having the
development mailing list. Do you think a forum would help users that
are not familiar with mailing lists? I'm happy to read your opinion!


That's all, folks. Enjoy yourself :)

Thomas
