<PRE>Hello,

As some of you might know I've been working with Thomas to do some  
usability tests with
gPodder in N900. I've created this test case for my Master's Thesis so  
I hope I could get
some comments so that I have same material to work with.

The idea was to test some basic functionality of gPodder and try to  
find usability
problems and issues from those. We conducted a set of think aloud  
usability tests and
came with videos from test sessions. Links to videos was posted here  
earlier by Thomas.

I've created a list of found usability issues which I'd like you to  
comment. I hope you
could post whiter you think these issues are something that needs to  
be solved. You can
post your suggestions for solutions as well. If you feel that some  
issue isn't actually a
usability issue at all and don't need to be taken into consideration  
please feel free to
comment that.

Here's the list I've created. I've listed some issues I found and then  
link to related
videos where the issue can be seen.

Task 1:
Subscribe to the podcast &quot;FLOSS Weekly&quot;

Issues:
There seems to be some confusion if a new podcast is being added. When  
&quot;Adding podcasts&quot;
label is shown there is no progress bar or anything like that. So user  
might be confused
is a new podcast being added or has gPodder freezed or what is going  
on if they are in
slow network and adding a podcast takes a long time
user seems confused
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud9Z9of-TtA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud9Z9of-TtA</A>

User mistypes the URL and doesn't know it.
Seems that user mistyped the url (missed s at the end of podcasts) and  
that's why the
first try didn't work. Now the feedback he gets is &quot;unknown feed  
type&quot;. Should it be more
like there's no feed at given url at all? I understand the current  
message that the feed
is somehow broken or invalid but it still exists. If the message would  
say that there is
no such feed at all then the user might check if he typed the URL correctly.

Task 2:
Download two latest FLOSS Weekly episodes and see the progress of the
downloads

Issues:
Should the progress of downloads be shown in main view so that users  
know they really are
downloading something? Or number of active downloads at
least?
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gng-KPsK1KM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gng-KPsK1KM</A>
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WMyaXqAwGk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WMyaXqAwGk</A>
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aj7F0xt0gs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aj7F0xt0gs</A>


Task 3:
Open the complete list of FLOSS Weekly episodes

Issues:
Title is &quot;All episodes&quot; but there is actually only newest episodes  
there. Is this
misleading title?
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-8peli61A8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-8peli61A8</A>


Task 4:
Set gPodder to find new episodes daily

Issues:
User doesn't find where to change settings.
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3w1hLMcWWg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3w1hLMcWWg</A>


Task6:
Subscribe to all the podcasts from the OPML-Podcast list
Subsribe to two podcasts from the OPML-Podcast list at URL.

Issues:
Should duplicate subscriptions to same feed be merged into one  
subscription or should
gPodder note user that the podcast is already been subscribed to?
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIExg04aJcE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIExg04aJcE</A>

Adding podcasts failed for some reason but there was no feedback what  
happened.
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1KUkHRkqxQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1KUkHRkqxQ</A>


Task 8:
Delete all the episodes that you have listened (don't delete them one by one)

Issues:
Deleted episodes disappear from the episode list. Should it only  
delete the downloaded
files but still show them in the episode list so that they can be  
downloaded again?
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqIEApj9h6U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqIEApj9h6U</A>
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lefdo4JdvGk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lefdo4JdvGk</A>
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9JR7LpgdqQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9JR7LpgdqQ</A>


Task 10:
Add youtube user &quot;QtStudios&quot; to your podcast list, download one of  
their youtube video
and play it.

Note:
Users couldn't download youtube videos. I think there was some bug in  
used gPodder
version.

Issues:
User didn't find search youtube users option in add podcast menu. He  
had no previous
experience of N900 at all which might have been a reason why he didn't  
know how to scroll
the menu.
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHvs7Zj46M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHvs7Zj46M</A>

Found youtube users were not in alphabetical order.
User didn't find QtStudios because he didn't enter it with capitals,  
was this some bug
because search doesn't seem to be case sensitive with other users.
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkXuT6aH8I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkXuT6aH8I</A>

User is confused if gPodder is doing anything when it says Adding  
podcast which takes
some time. Should there be some indicator of progress to make clear  
that something is
really been done?
