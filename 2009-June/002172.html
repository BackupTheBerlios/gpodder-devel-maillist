<PRE>I have also noticed this lately. I think the mismatch in emblems occurred
just before .16 was released. I've been meaning to check bug reports but I
haven't had time to sit down and figure out what they are supposed to be.
I've also noticed that the numbers listed in the left pane don't seem to be
correct either, but again I have not had time to figure out what they are
doing.

Please check out the bugs and enter one if needed.

Thanks,
-Bill

&gt;<i> Thanks Bill, that sounds like the explanation. However, I am still
</I>&gt;<i> confused:) I am using 0.16.0. If I right click on an episode the pop up
</I>&gt;<i> menu, which has a music note with a green tick on it, the pop up says
</I>&gt;<i> Mark as Played, but the pop up also has a green tick on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I choose &quot;Mark as Played&quot; the green tick disappears. Now if I right
</I>&gt;<i> click again I get &quot;Mark as Unplayed&quot; with a red cross on the pop up.
</I>&gt;<i> Selecting this gives me the music note icon with a green tick next to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reference to the icons in the wiki is out of date, so I am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> what they mean.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I were to guess I would assume the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Music icon with green tick - it's got a tick, so it's been played.
</I>&gt;<i> Music icon with no tick - it's unplayed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the pop up menu:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mark as Played&quot; should have a green tick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mark as Unplayed&quot; shouldn't have a red cross, but should either have
</I>&gt;<i> nothing or another icon that is the same as whatever will be displayed
</I>&gt;<i> next to the music note in the list view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere obvious in the app, the user should be able to find help on
</I>&gt;<i> what the various icons mean.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone can enlighten me as to what the various icon/pop up states
</I>&gt;<i> should be, I'll attempt to write a patch that makes it more obvious to
</I>&gt;<i> the user and amend the wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ian.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sounds like they are not being marked as played. I usually just mark
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them as played and then the next time I sync, those episodes are removed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the device. I'm not sure it makes sense to have them automatically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marked as read, because you may be removing it from the device because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the file is corrupt or something and you want it to be re-synced.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     I don't know if this is a feature or a bug:) If I choose &quot;Select and

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     are synced back to the device next time I choose &quot;Sync episodes to
