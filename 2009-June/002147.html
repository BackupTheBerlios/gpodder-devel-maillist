<PRE>Hello,

I wrote the &quot;manage device playlist&quot; feature, which includes the
following tasks:
- after synchronize to the filebased device you are able to open a
window which shows all episodes on the device. 

- deleted episodes are automatically removed from the list. I remove my
episodes from the device with the following option:
&quot;Delete episodes on device that have been marked played in gPodder&quot;

- new episodes are on the top of the list but they are marked as &quot;not
used&quot;. &quot;Not used&quot; episodes are marked with the comment character # in
the m3u file and are not playable on the device.

- Now you are able to order the episodes and mark them as used or
unused.


For this usecase I added the following settings, which you can find in
the Advanced gPodder Configuration Editor:
- mp3_player_playlist_absolute_path
- mp3_player_playlist_file
- mp3_player_playlist_win_path

You find my added &quot;gPodderPlaylist&quot; class in src/gpodder/gui.py.
I also added a new menu entry to open the Playlist Editor Window.


There is another playlist feature in gPodder, which creates a m3u-file
for every channel if the advanced option &quot;create_m3u_playlists&quot; is true.
(&quot;PodcastChannel.update_m3u_playlist&quot; in src/gpodder/libpodcast.py)
But I didn't wrote this feature. Also I doesn't know anything about
gPodder in combination with an iPod.


If you would like to add one playlist per feed automatically you should
- in my opinion - add a new setting for mtp devices and add some
functionality to the sync process.
My usecase - and playlist handling - is different because I would like
to have only one playlist in which I can handle the ordering manually.

@Thomas: What do you think how to implement this feature for the
mtp-based devices?
