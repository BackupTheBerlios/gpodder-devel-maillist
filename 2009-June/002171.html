<PRE>Thanks Bill, that sounds like the explanation. However, I am still 
confused:) I am using 0.16.0. If I right click on an episode the pop up 
menu, which has a music note with a green tick on it, the pop up says 
Mark as Played, but the pop up also has a green tick on it.

If I choose &quot;Mark as Played&quot; the green tick disappears. Now if I right 
click again I get &quot;Mark as Unplayed&quot; with a red cross on the pop up. 
Selecting this gives me the music note icon with a green tick next to it.

The reference to the icons in the wiki is out of date, so I am not sure 
what they mean.

If I were to guess I would assume the following:

Music icon with green tick - it's got a tick, so it's been played.
Music icon with no tick - it's unplayed.

In the pop up menu:

&quot;Mark as Played&quot; should have a green tick.

&quot;Mark as Unplayed&quot; shouldn't have a red cross, but should either have 
nothing or another icon that is the same as whatever will be displayed 
next to the music note in the list view.

Somewhere obvious in the app, the user should be able to find help on 
what the various icons mean.

If someone can enlighten me as to what the various icon/pop up states 
should be, I'll attempt to write a patch that makes it more obvious to 
the user and amend the wiki.

Ian.
