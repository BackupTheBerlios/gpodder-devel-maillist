<PRE>Hi Jorge,

That's true. Still, there should be some visual indicator on how the
feed update is progressing. On the other hand, we are in the progress of
integrating mygpo-feedservice at some point in the future, which should
make the feed parsing/downloading faster and less bandwidth-hungry,
maybe eliminating the need for a progress bar (we could simply show the
update progress directly in the podcast list by showing e.g. an overlay
icon of some sort).

&gt;<i> However, I transfer all the new podcasts to my device regularly, one
</I>&gt;<i> action that can't be automatized. So I'd even go for a &#171;transfer all
</I>&gt;<i> podcasts&#187; button, I believe it's more important.
</I>
There's Ctrl+S (think &quot;sync&quot;) for that, and it should be more efficient.

&gt;<i> Hiding the toolbar is not a problem, because the toolbar is shown by
</I>&gt;<i> default. If an user hides it, he knows he loose some controls. It seems
</I>&gt;<i> normal to me.
</I>
That's true. Still, ideally I'd get rid of the toolbar and maybe replace
it with something else. I'm not totally happy with the toolbar's
contents, too, e.g. the &quot;Quit&quot; button is kind of unnecessary when you
have windowmanager controls to do the same (+ Ctrl+W/Ctrl+Q as shorcut).

&gt;<i> You definitely have your point, I know there's no single solution and
</I>&gt;<i> that subjectivity takes an important role here. I only want to expose my
</I>&gt;<i> point of view based on my use cases as a real user of this application.
</I>
I'm thankful for you input :) We focus on a clean and usable interface,
so any improvements that we could do there are well appreciated!


Thanks,
Thomas
