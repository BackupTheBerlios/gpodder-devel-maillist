</I>&gt;<i> ... what should we name it ... libgpodder? :)
</I>
What about libmygpoqt or libmygpo-qt (with &quot;mygpo&quot; being the project
name of &quot;gpodder.net&quot;, from its old domain name [my].[gp]odder.[o]rg)?
Another idea would be libmygpoclient-qt.

&gt;<i> Our Priority will stay of Course to integrate gpodder into Amarok, so we

</I>&gt;<i> into the Library, then use them in Amarok and if we didn't wrap the
</I>&gt;<i> whole API and our Amarok Feature is finished we will see further ;)
</I>
That's a great approach - it will definitely help in making the API
usable, as you are designing it with the goal of using it right
afterwards, so the short write-use-fix cycle will make the library
better.

&gt;<i> @Thomas: Your Help is definitly aprreciated, but as this is an ASE
</I>&gt;<i> Project we most probably can't really accept help in the Areas of Coding
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; Design ... but you can definitly look over our Design/Code and find
</I>&gt;<i> Bugs that we're gonna produce :)
</I>
No problem - looking forward to testing and using the library! :)


Thanks,
Thomas
