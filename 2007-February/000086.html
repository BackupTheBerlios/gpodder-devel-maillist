Sounds motivated :) By all means, if you've got the time and
motivation, work on the code and send patches. We can always decide to
include it after 0.9 but if we have it ready and stable for 0.9, we'll
have it in 0.9 too.

I'd really like to see patches for items on the TODO list :)


Enjoy.
Thomas
