<PRE>Hello John,

</I>
The problem is with podcasts changing name, etc it would be very hard
to keep track of each of the podcasts. You can, however, use the
function &quot;Sync to MP3 player&quot; to sync to some folder in your home
directory, and a folder structure will be created with correct names on
sync :)

</I>
Try the following: Set &quot;Player application to &quot;Shell command&quot; and use
the following string:

rhythmbox-client --play-uri=%u

After that, rhythmbox should start playing the file immediately :)

&gt;<i> 3)  Finally, could it mark via a different color code when a podcast
</I>&gt;<i> has been played.
</I>
Would be easily added, but I don't know if it's a good idea since
gPodder can't check if you've really played through the whole podcast
with the player application. Of course, we could mark every podcast on
which &quot;Play&quot; has been clicked, but I don't know if this is what you
desire?


Enjoy.
Thomas
