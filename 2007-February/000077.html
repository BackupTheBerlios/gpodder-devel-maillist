<PRE>Hello nikosapi,

The feed seems to be broken. I'd really like to fix it in gPodder, but
there is no easy way to do this. Of course, if this bug would persist
over several feeds because there is some widely-adopted podcasting tool
that writes the wrong data, we could workaround this in gPodder. But
this seems like an error from a hand-crafted RSS feed.

</I>&gt;<i> value when an exception happens with parsedate_tz() to &lt; 0 fixes this.
</I>
Does this really fix all possible exceptions like when there's just one
broken episode pubDate or the whole feed? Does it also take into
considerations the time when the feed moves on from &quot;Febuary&quot; to March?

I'd like to fix this, but currently don't know how to do this in an
easy way.


Thanks,
Thomas
