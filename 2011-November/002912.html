<PRE>Hi Thomas,

thanks for the quick reply.

That explanation is really useful. Two quick questions:

What does deleted really mean? From the word, I expected that these episodes 
are deleted from the device (which makes only for download episodes real sense 
(?)). Or is it just another state beside new and old?

I have now lots of new episodes which I did not mark as old in the past. Can I 
mark all not downloaded episodes as old? If it is not possible with the GUI, 
does it work with a wrapper shell script for the command line?

Many thanks,
Rainer
