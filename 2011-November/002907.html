Hey,

as Amarok 2.5 Release (and with it hopefully the gpodder.net
Integration) is soon, we need to fix the Service.

As discussed with Stefan K&#246;gl &amp; Thomas Perl, I forward this discussion
also to the gpodder Mailinglist (and hope that maybe some people who
use gpodder want to help a little bit with testing).

Known problems atm:
- -) Episode Actions are sent every 30 seconds always including the last
position (and also not sent for skipped parts)
- -) Episode Actions are not correctly sent if a podcast includes a
&quot;last stop postion&quot; mark but user starts to play from position 0
- -) Annoying popup related to KIO (wrapper around QNetworkAccessManager)

This Popup is related to the isPossibleSpoofingAttack Method in
<A HREF="https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdelibs/repository/revisions/master/entry/kioslave/http/http.cpp">https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdelibs/repository/revisions/master/entry/kioslave/http/http.cpp</A>
&amp; libmygpo-qt setting the data for http basic auth in the url.

@thp: Could you maybe explain how you handle the Episode Actions in
the gpodder App? This could maybe be a good way also for amarok.

@skoegl: Any chance to implement some other Auth Mechanism than basic
auth (I know there is the auth api, but that too needs basic auth) in
gpodder.net really soon?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Amarok.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so probably at first we don't want to send Playlist Actions also
</I>&gt;<i> for skips (I will explain in a few Minutes what this could be good
</I>&gt;<i> for).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still we need to change the existing implementation. Without
</I>&gt;<i> sending skips and only wanting to know where we stopped, only 1
</I>&gt;<i> EpisodeAction for Play should be uploaded to the Server (and not
</I>&gt;<i> one every Minute or half Minute). This Episode Action should
</I>&gt;<i> probably be sent when the user clicks pause or stop and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> resume listening in e.g. 1 minute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course we know the gpodder.net service can be unreliable from
</I>&gt;<i> time to time, but I also think the case where a user stops
</I>&gt;<i> listening a Podcast, shuts down Amarok &amp; his computer (and
</I>&gt;<i> gpodder.net didn't work and the episode action couldn't be sent in
</I>&gt;<i> time) and then wants to continue listening the Podcast on his
</I>&gt;<i> mobile is not soo common.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why it makes sense to upload (and it isn't that inefficient,
</I>&gt;<i> keeping some data structures in memory and uploading them as a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch if nothing [related to this episode or podcast in general]
</I>&gt;<i> happened for 1 Minute doesn't &quot;cost&quot; much more then uploading a
</I>&gt;<i> single action) also skips?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Atm this Data is only used (and visible) internally in gpodder.net
</I>&gt;<i> for Podcast Producers. But Bart made a good point,
</I>&gt;<i> (crowd-sourcing) chaptering of podcast episodes would be a cool
</I>&gt;<i> feature for gpodder.net.
