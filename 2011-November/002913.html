</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, that's not a bug - independent of which filter you choose, new (not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet downloaded, &quot;blue&quot; highlight) episodes and downloading (currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being downloaded) episodes are always shown.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea behind this is that whenever there are new episodes, you either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download them or mark them as old.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the same way, &quot;Deleted&quot; means &quot;All, including deleted&quot;, and &quot;All&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really means &quot;Hide deleted, show the rest&quot; but as you can see from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screenshot, we are pretty limited in terms of screen space, so we chose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these short words.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That explanation is really useful. Two quick questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does deleted really mean? From the word, I expected that these
</I>&gt;<i> episodes are deleted from the device (which makes only for download
</I>&gt;<i> episodes real sense (?)). Or is it just another state beside new and
</I>&gt;<i> old?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have now lots of new episodes which I did not mark as old in the
</I>&gt;<i> past. Can I mark all not downloaded episodes as old? If it is not
</I>&gt;<i> possible with the GUI, does it work with a wrapper shell script for
</I>&gt;<i> the command line?
</I>
You can do this by updating the feeds, after that you should get a list
of new episodes - mark the ones you do not want and select &quot;Mark as old&quot;
in the lower left corner.

&quot;Deleted&quot; episodes are basically episodes that are deleted after being
downloaded, but you can also choose to delete episodes that you never
downloaded (basically to remove episodes from the &quot;All&quot; view - e.g. if
it's a serial podcast, you might want to mark everything as new, but you
want to listen to every podcast eventually - with &quot;deleted&quot; you can do
that).

HTH :)
