Enjoy :)

======================================================================
2011-11-07 - gPodder 3.0.0 &quot;397/D&quot; released

This is the release you have been waiting for for nearly a year -
gPodder 3.0.0, the first release of the &quot;tres&quot; branch is out and ready
for you to give it a test drive. There are too many changes to list them
one by one, so I'll just give you a high-level overview of what's in for
you:

  * Device synchronization removed: We have removed the ability to sync
    to iPod, MTP and filesystem-based MP3 players. You can store your
    gPodder data on your mobile device directly for now (using
    $GPODDER_HOME) or wait for someone to implement a syncing plugin.

  * New on-disk structure: Instead of having &quot;gpodder-downloads&quot; in your
    home folder, and the database and settings hidden away in another
    folder, all gPodder data is now stored in &quot;gPodder&quot; in your home
    directory (on Linux) or in &quot;gPodder&quot; in you &quot;My Documents&quot; folder
    (on Windows) or on the mass storage (MyDocs partition) on the N900
    and N9. The database format has also been overhauled, you can use
    the &quot;gpodder-migrate2tres&quot; script to convert your gPodder 2 data to
    gPodder 3. Because all data is now stored in one folder, you can now
    use the Desktop version of gPodder to work on e.g. the gPodder
    downloaded data on your mobile device by pointing the $GPODDER_HOME
    environment variable to the storage device.

  * EQL: The so-called &quot;Episode Query Language&quot; allows you to write
    queries against your podcasts. For example, you can use &quot;(audio and
    downloaded and minutes &lt; 10)&quot; to show all downloaded audio files
    that are shorter than 10 minutes to listen to. This is very
    powerful, and can currently be used in the episode list of the GTK
    UI using &quot;search-as-you-type&quot;.

  * Improvements to the GTK UI, including support for showing the
    duration in the episode list, and hiding of columns in the episode
    list.

  * New QML-based touch UI: In addition to the GTK UI and the
    command-line interface, gPodder 3 contains a QML UI for use with
    PySide. This UI can be used on touch-enabled netbooks/laptops and on
    mobile devices. The QML UI is the only mobile UI supported in 3.0.0
    (replacing the Hildon UI in previous releases).

  * Web UI: While this is still in its early stages, there is a small
    Web UI included that (when complete) will make it possible to manage
    gPodder via a web browser (with the help of a local, embedded web
    server).

  * Refined backend / data model: The codebase has been cleaned up and
    restructured, so it should be easier to maintain and add to in the
    future.

  * Support for Woodchuck: Neal Walfield has contributed a plugin for
    his Woodchuck framework. With Woodchuck installed, your device can
    detect which podcasts you like and automatically download the right
    episodes.

  * Better support for Windows: The Windows launcher has been refined,
    and Windows users can now also use the CLI in addition to the GTK
    GUI. The new version will also use a system-wide installation of
    Python 2.7 and PyGTK, and auto-download the installers for these
    dependencies if they are not found. This means smaller package sizes
    and better disk usage.

  * Dropped support for Maemo 4 (N800, N810) and Maemo 5 Hildon (N900)

  * Added support for Maemo 5 QML (N900) and MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan (N9)

For packages in various distributions, see the downloads page.

With the release of the &quot;tres&quot; branch, gPodder 2 is put into maintenance
mode, with 2.20 being the latest release at the moment. Maintenance mode
means for us that we will only release updates in case bugs are found
and reported. We will not be adding new features, but if translators
update the (now frozen) strings, we will also push out new updates every
now and then. Also, we might consider merging patches against 2.x. When
a new bugfix release of gPodder 2.x is made, we will still create
packages for Maemo 4 and Maemo 5 users.

For Maemo 5 users wishing to upgrade to 3.0.0, we will provide packages
for the new release soon - in that case, only the QML UI is supported,
and users are encouraged to install the Maemo 5 Community SSU if they
want to use the QML UI on their devices.

MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan packages will be provided via the Nokia Store.

This release also changes something in the Git repository: The &quot;tres&quot;
branch gets renamed to &quot;master&quot; (the master branch), and the old master
branch (2.x) is renamed to &quot;two&quot;.

Also, coinciding with the release of gPodder 3, we have a new mailing
list on freelists.org.

This is just the beginning, though - with gPodder 3 finally out, the
flood gates are once more open for new features to land in the master
branch :)

Look out for new updates for your favorite podcatcher soon. In the mean
time, if you find any bugs, please report them at
<A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/.">http://bugs.gpodder.org/.</A> Thanks to all who have made this release
possible, and who helped support the gPodder project over the last year
that it took to get &quot;tres&quot; in shape! Enjoy gPodder 3 :)
