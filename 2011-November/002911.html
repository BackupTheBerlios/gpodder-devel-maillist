No, that's not a bug - independent of which filter you choose, new (not
yet downloaded, &quot;blue&quot; highlight) episodes and downloading (currently
being downloaded) episodes are always shown.

The idea behind this is that whenever there are new episodes, you either
download them or mark them as old.

In the same way, &quot;Deleted&quot; means &quot;All, including deleted&quot;, and &quot;All&quot;
really means &quot;Hide deleted, show the rest&quot; but as you can see from the
screenshot, we are pretty limited in terms of screen space, so we chose
these short words.

HTH.
