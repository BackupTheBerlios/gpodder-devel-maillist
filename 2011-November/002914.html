Wow, that sounds very interesting! If we could provide a native-looking
and self-contained &quot;gPodder.app&quot; experience, that would be great for
many OS X users, I suppose. Are you developing this on top of the
&quot;master&quot; branch (2.x) or &quot;tres&quot; (Really Soon Now(tm) 3.x)? It would be
great if we could have that soon after the 3.0.0 release, and even offer
it by default for end users (while advanced users can still choose the
MacPorts version, or build from source).

I haven't had time to test it personally (currently all my gPodder time
is devoted to getting gPodder 3.0.0 in shape and out there), but would
be very happy to see this become stable and also to merge any changes
that you think might be worth getting back into the main repository.


Thanks,
Thomas
