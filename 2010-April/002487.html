<PRE>Hi all,

On certain players you can install the rockbox software. This does not wipe out the original firmware. The player really becomes a dual-boot player, using either rockbox or the original firmware. The rockbox software provides exactly the desired properties:

&gt;<i> - It would be nice to somehow have podcasts and music
</I>&gt;<i> seperated on
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; the player. I don't want a &quot;music library&quot; where I
</I>
Rockbox presents itself as a &quot;mass storage device&quot;, so you can put the files whereever you want to put them. I have a directory &quot;podcasts&quot;, underneath of which gPodder stores the podcasts, one directory per channel.

&gt;<i> - The player should remember the position for each single
</I>&gt;<i> podcast
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; and resume there later. I often switch between
</I>
Mmmm..... Rockbox definitely does this for the file it is playing when you switch off while playing. I don't know if it can keep track of &quot;stopped position per track&quot;.

&gt;<i> - The fast-forwarding shouldn't be too slow. I hate it when
</I>
In rockbox, the fast forward (and reverse) speed increases while using, so even a three-hour episode can be FFWD in a matter of seconds. The &quot;FFWD speed up&quot; can be set up to individual wish.

The only downside of rockbox is that only somewhat older models of players are supported. See the website 

<A HREF="http://www.rockbox.org/">http://www.rockbox.org/</A> 

I use rockbox on an iPod 5th generation (iPod Video, 30 GB), and it works very well. In my case, I would like to get a new player (mine is getting old), but I want an Apple because of all the surrounding infrastructure: docking stations at home, connector in the car, etc. But rockbox cannot be installed on the latest iPods, and iPod + linux does not mix very well :-)) Apple is very clever: by allowing many third parties to make all kinds of accessories, they make sure that once you have an iPod, you will likely buy a new iPod, because otherwise you'll have to buy everything new....

</I>&gt;<i> A week ago I bought a Philips GoGear SA1942, but I'm going
</I>&gt;<i> to send
</I>&gt;<i> it back because it's exactly missing a good resume and
</I>&gt;<i> fast-forward
</I>&gt;<i> and that sucks. So if you have a good player you're happy
</I>&gt;<i> with,
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know. :)
