<PRE>Hello!

As promised, work on my.gpodder.org continues as planned, and if you
have logged into the web service recently, you might have noticed the
initial code drop that supports chapters and bookmarks. We are still
working on the client-side integration, but feel free to try it out on
the website.

In other news, we are re-designing the navigation and style of the web
service to make it more useful and decoupled from the gpodder.org
website. For this we will be re-launching the web service soon under
the gpodder.net domain (the domain my.gpodder.org will work as an alias
for the new domain, just like gpodder.net works as an alias for
my.gpodder.org now).

This will also decouple the web service from the rest of the gpodder.org
website, so that it's more clear (from the domain name and from the
optical appearance) to users and casual visitors that the web service is
not bound to gPodder-only client, but is open for all kinds of client
application support.

To sweeten the deal, I've created a minimal example script called
&quot;bpsync&quot;, which will allow you to up- and download your BashPodder
subscription list to the web service. If you set up your cron jobs on
your media center server correctly, you can then manage your BashPodder
subscriptions from gpodder.net without having to SSH into the server and
edit the bp.conf file by hand. The script is available from the
mygpoclient Git repository.

Again, if anybody wants to work on integration of the web service with
other applications, feel free to get in touch :)


Enjoy the weekend!
Thomas
