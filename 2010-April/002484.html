&gt;<i> Hi folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A week ago I had to learn the fact that an iPod Nano doesn't survive
</I>&gt;<i> the washing machine. I'm not exactly sad about that because iPod
</I>&gt;<i> syncing with Linux has always been a mess anyway and for my next
</I>&gt;<i> player there will be one certain requirement: no more Apple.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But since I've been handling all my podcasts with gPodder for a long
</I>&gt;<i> time I think it's best to just ask around here if you have any
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations for a new player. I would like to go for a cheap
</I>&gt;<i> solution: No video or any file format besides MP3 is needed and 4 GB is
</I>&gt;<i> enough. And since I'm a podcast fan and barely listen to music on
</I>&gt;<i> the device, I would like it to somehow be podcast aware:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - It would be nice to somehow have podcasts and music seperated on
</I>&gt;<i>  the player. I don't want a &quot;music library&quot; where I have to look
</I>&gt;<i>  for the podcasts between all the music. Basically simple
</I>&gt;<i>  file-system browsing is all I need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The player should remember the position for each single podcast
</I>&gt;<i>  and resume there later. I often switch between different very long
</I>&gt;<i>  podcasts and it's nice not to have to manually search for the last
</I>&gt;<i>  position. This is the most important feature and what I actually
</I>&gt;<i>  liked about the iPod.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The fast-forwarding shouldn't be too slow. I hate it when I
</I>&gt;<i>  accidentally hit a button in a 3 hour podcasts and then have to
</I>&gt;<i>  hold the fast-forward button for 5 minutes because it's so slow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A week ago I bought a Philips GoGear SA1942, but I'm going to send
</I>&gt;<i> it back because it's exactly missing a good resume and fast-forward
</I>&gt;<i> and that sucks. So if you have a good player you're happy with,
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
