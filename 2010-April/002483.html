<PRE>Hi folks,

A week ago I had to learn the fact that an iPod Nano doesn't survive
the washing machine. I'm not exactly sad about that because iPod
syncing with Linux has always been a mess anyway and for my next
player there will be one certain requirement: no more Apple.

But since I've been handling all my podcasts with gPodder for a long
time I think it's best to just ask around here if you have any
recommendations for a new player. I would like to go for a cheap
solution: No video or any file format besides MP3 is needed and 4 GB is
enough. And since I'm a podcast fan and barely listen to music on
the device, I would like it to somehow be podcast aware:

- It would be nice to somehow have podcasts and music seperated on
  the player. I don't want a &quot;music library&quot; where I have to look
  for the podcasts between all the music. Basically simple
  file-system browsing is all I need.

- The player should remember the position for each single podcast
  and resume there later. I often switch between different very long
  podcasts and it's nice not to have to manually search for the last
  position. This is the most important feature and what I actually
  liked about the iPod.

- The fast-forwarding shouldn't be too slow. I hate it when I
  accidentally hit a button in a 3 hour podcasts and then have to
  hold the fast-forward button for 5 minutes because it's so slow.

A week ago I bought a Philips GoGear SA1942, but I'm going to send
it back because it's exactly missing a good resume and fast-forward
and that sucks. So if you have a good player you're happy with,
please let me know. :)

Sebastian
