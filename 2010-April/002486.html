</I>&gt;<i> The Sansa Clip would be fine, but...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - It would be nice to somehow have podcasts and music seperated on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the player. I don't want a &quot;music library&quot; where I have to look
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for the podcasts between all the music. Basically simple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   file-system browsing is all I need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can kind of do that, the Clip separates files tagged with the genre
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;podcast&quot; from any other files. That doesn't quite work as well as it
</I>&gt;<i> could, though. AFAIK there's no way of queuing all podcasts at once, you
</I>&gt;<i> can only queue all episodes of the same podcast. Since the Clip supports
</I>&gt;<i> playlists, you'd think this could be worked around by creating a
</I>&gt;<i> playlist of all podcasts, but you can't put files tagged with &quot;podcast&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> into the playlists, the Clip just doesn't see those files when playing
</I>&gt;<i> the list. The way I do it is I make sure the podcast files have no genre
</I>&gt;<i> tags at all and then I make a playlist of them and set the Clip to play
</I>&gt;<i> the list, but then music and podcasts aren't separated when browsing the
</I>&gt;<i> files. I haven't tested the newest firmware too thoroughly, so some of
</I>&gt;<i> this stuff might be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can also put files in /PODCASTS, and they will be separated by the
</I>firmware.
Also, the Clip+ has file browsing, as does the open source Rockbox firmware
which can be put on certain Clips.



&gt;<i> &gt; - The player should remember the position for each single podcast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   and resume there later. I often switch between different very long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   podcasts and it's nice not to have to manually search for the last
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   position. This is the most important feature and what I actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   liked about the iPod.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the Clip does this for every file, probably just for the
</I>&gt;<i> current file, but I'm not sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It does it for all files recognized as podcasts.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The fast-forwarding shouldn't be too slow. I hate it when I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   accidentally hit a button in a 3 hour podcasts and then have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   hold the fast-forward button for 5 minutes because it's so slow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The FF in the Clip gets faster the longer you hold the button, at least
</I>&gt;<i> to a certain point. It's been fast enough for me with podcasts such as
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux Link Tech Show and its two hour episodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Works for me.
