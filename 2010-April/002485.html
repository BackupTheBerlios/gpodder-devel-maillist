The Sansa Clip would be fine, but...

&gt;<i> - It would be nice to somehow have podcasts and music seperated on
</I>&gt;<i>   the player. I don't want a &quot;music library&quot; where I have to look
</I>&gt;<i>   for the podcasts between all the music. Basically simple
</I>&gt;<i>   file-system browsing is all I need.
</I>
You can kind of do that, the Clip separates files tagged with the genre
&quot;podcast&quot; from any other files. That doesn't quite work as well as it
could, though. AFAIK there's no way of queuing all podcasts at once, you
can only queue all episodes of the same podcast. Since the Clip supports
playlists, you'd think this could be worked around by creating a
playlist of all podcasts, but you can't put files tagged with &quot;podcast&quot;
into the playlists, the Clip just doesn't see those files when playing
the list. The way I do it is I make sure the podcast files have no genre
tags at all and then I make a playlist of them and set the Clip to play
the list, but then music and podcasts aren't separated when browsing the
files. I haven't tested the newest firmware too thoroughly, so some of
this stuff might be fixed.

&gt;<i> - The player should remember the position for each single podcast
</I>&gt;<i>   and resume there later. I often switch between different very long
</I>&gt;<i>   podcasts and it's nice not to have to manually search for the last
</I>&gt;<i>   position. This is the most important feature and what I actually
</I>&gt;<i>   liked about the iPod.
</I>
I don't think the Clip does this for every file, probably just for the
current file, but I'm not sure.

&gt;<i> - The fast-forwarding shouldn't be too slow. I hate it when I
</I>&gt;<i>   accidentally hit a button in a 3 hour podcasts and then have to
</I>&gt;<i>   hold the fast-forward button for 5 minutes because it's so slow.
</I>
The FF in the Clip gets faster the longer you hold the button, at least
to a certain point. It's been fast enough for me with podcasts such as
the Linux Link Tech Show and its two hour episodes.
