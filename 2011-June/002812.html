<PRE>Hi Dov,

</I>
Yes, exactly. Also, in &quot;tres&quot;, only the QML UI has built-in playback
support for now. The GTK+ UI has many improvements and fixes, but it
still uses the old &quot;play in external player&quot; method.

&gt;<i> Just some background on my &quot;setup&quot;: I run gpodder on my (Linux) desktop
</I>&gt;<i> and on my n900. On the desktop, currently, my media player of choice is VLC,
</I>&gt;<i> on the n900 I play the media via the n900's native Media
</I>&gt;<i> Player. The main use cases I'm interested in
</I>&gt;<i> having support for are listening to part of an episode and stopping at
</I>&gt;<i> at some point, and later resuming from the same point, possibly from
</I>&gt;<i> a different machine.
</I>
Yes, that's also the use case that we want to support (and if it doesn't
work, we'll happily work together with you to fix the issues).

&gt;<i>  (3) works flawlessly for me with the default media player. I believe
</I>&gt;<i>      that this is acheived by gpodder telling the media player
</I>&gt;<i>      where to resume using mafw's D-Bus API, so this solution is
</I>&gt;<i>      specific to the n900/mafw.
</I>
Yes, but if the player provides an API for resuming, we could add this
(I can also imagine something like using a variable/placeholder like
$POSITION or __position__, etc.. in the custom command line that would
then get replaced with the resuming position).

&gt;<i>  (1) Only panucci reports back the last-played position using gpodder's
</I>&gt;<i>      Media Player D-Bus API. I've started looking into writing a VLC
</I>&gt;<i>      plugin to do this, and it actually looks like it shouldn't be very
</I>&gt;<i>      difficult, but I'm new to VLC and the going is slow... So for now,
</I>&gt;<i>      the only &quot;last-played&quot; information available to gpodder on the
</I>&gt;<i>      desktop is that coming from my.gpodder.net. However, that's good
</I>&gt;<i>      enough for discussing some further points.
</I>
Yep, that's how we plan to support players like VLC, it would be great
if you could write a plug-in. Here's the documentation of what signals
you need to post on the D-Bus Session Bus, if gPodder is running, it
will do the right thing with the information:

    <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/Media_Player_D-Bus_API">http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/Media_Player_D-Bus_API</A>

&gt;<i> [...] Should I open an issue against the web service for this?
</I>
This question is probably something for our resident gpodder.net master
Stefan Koegl. Stefan: What do you think?

&gt;<i> One additional idea I've had, and am interested in hearing feedback, is
</I>&gt;<i> to create a standalone application which would stand between gpodder
</I>&gt;<i> and the media players, would talk with gpodder via the Media Player
</I>&gt;<i> D-Bus API and the command line, and then talk with different media
</I>&gt;<i> players via their own APIs. That would allow gpodder to have only
</I>&gt;<i> simple, generic, APIs, and move the complexity of dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> different media players to a separate, isolated, layer. Any thoughts?
</I>
Isn't the Media Player D-Bus API already very simple and generic? I'm not sure
what additional features the standalone application would provide; maybe you
have some examples?

&gt;<i> Anyhow, this was rather long, but I'd be happy to hear any feedback, and
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that the patches which are mature enough can be applied as is.
</I>
Sure, I have commented on the ones that I thought had something to add. Please
keep bumping the patches every few weeks if I forget to merge/review one of
them.

Thanks,
Thomas
