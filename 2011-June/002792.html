<PRE>Hi, Thomas,

First: thanks for your thoughtful comments and observations!

I've tried to respond to your concerns inline.  Due to the length,
I've summarize the main points here.

Woodchuck's goal is to improve data availability, the likelihood that
data that a user is interested in is available when the user wants to
access it.  There are three main issues that impair data availability
for mobile devices: limited energy, data caps, and cellular coverage.

Woodchuck focus is on improving data availability for
subscription-based, delay-tolerant data, while burdening the user as
little as possible.  This rules out *requiring* the user to configure
every single podcast subscription, etc.  Instead, Woodchuck will use
machine learning to (1) understand the context (time and place) in
which users access data, to (2) understand how they use the data (only
newest, serially, randomly, etc.), and to (3) understand how data is
published.  (Note: we explicitly do not want to reduce the user's
control; we just want to make the default behavior more often meet the
user's expectations.)

Understanding how data is used means not only knowing that some file
was accessed but some of the file's features, e.g., the publication
time, the download time, what other files have the same origin, etc.
Using these features, it is possible to group data and look for
correlations.  Thus, Woodchuck might decide to download the hourly
news at 4 PM over the corporate WiFi network because the user
typically listens to the hourly news on the commute home.  Similarly,
it might decide not to download the latest episode of a sitcom to save
energy, because it knows the user hasn't yet watched the last few
episodes and thus likely won't need that data before the next time
there is power and WiFi.

Extracting these types of features requires application support.
That's the reason the interface is more complex than something like:
&quot;I'd like to download X MB at the next available time.&quot;  That
information doesn't allow Woodchuck to make very good inferences.

</I>&gt;<i> download, can I download now or will you tell me when I can?&quot; more
</I>&gt;<i> suitable and not so object-specific? What do you gain (apart from API
</I>&gt;<i> complexity ;) by having all these objects floating around between an
</I>&gt;<i> application and Woodchuck?
</I>
I wasn't aware of the heartbeat daemon, thanks for point it out.  (For
google: after some searching, the only documentation I found is in the
libiphb.h header file from the libiphb-dev package.)

From looking at the interface, it appears that iphbd primarily does
gang CPU scheduling.  Woodchuck is more ambitious.  Woodchuck
optimizes for battery usage, data usage and cellular coverage.  Gang
scheduling might help with saving power, but even then, completely
avoiding unnecessary downloads saves even more power.

To understand the complexity of what Woodchuck hopes to accomplish,
just consider how to manage downloads for a user who has access to
multiple networks with different data budgets and coverages.  If the
user is connected to the cellular network, should new podcasts be
downloaded?  The answer is: it depends.  It depends on the data
budget, how convinced we are that the user will need the data before
conditions improve (e.g., WiFi becomes available), the probability of
not having any coverage when the data is needed, and the cost of not
having the data when it is needed.

Machine learning allows us to learn from history to make predictions
about the future thereby improving the answers to the previous
questions.  Machine learning requires understanding the data (or, more
accurately, the ability to extract useful features from the data).  If
Woodchuck is to assume responsibility for scheduling downloads, then I
suspect that better scheduling can be achieved by having richer
interfaces than those that iphbd provides.

One could ask whether it really makes sense to use a central
scheduling entity or whether applications, with their
application-specific knowledge, couldn't do better.  First, I suspect
that some library is needed: making these types of inferences is
complicated and I think most application developers would appreciate
help.  If we introduce a library, then the application-specific
information is being abstracted anyways.  In this case, we're better
off using a central entity, as it can then also bring information from
different applications together (i.e., make cross-domain inferences).
Finally, some centralized entity makes sense as the data and energy
budgets are shared resources and thus some mechanism is require to
coordinate their use.

&gt;<i> Also, what does Woodchuck do with the information whether or not an
</I>&gt;<i> update is successful?
</I>
If Woodchuck knows that an update failed, it can reschedule a new
update sooner.  It also knows when the user explicitly requests an
update, which means that it needs to reconsider that stream's update
schedule.

&gt;<i> &gt; When the user listens to a podcast, gPodder reports this to Woodchuck
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (pywoodchuck.object_used).  That way, Woodchuck can learn the user's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preferences.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't that something that requires knowledge of the data in question? If
</I>&gt;<i> you know that object 01abcd has been listened to, how can Woodchuck
</I>&gt;<i> determine whether or not the user is interested in object bb0a256?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, isn't downloading detached from consuming/listening to files? I
</I>&gt;<i> might listen to a given episode the first time two weeks after it has
</I>&gt;<i> been downloaded - what kind of use would this be to Woodchuck?
</I>
If all the information you have is that there are two objects with
some cryptic names and that the user has listened to one of them,
sure, you can't infer much.  But, I think that users are often
predictable (i.e., have habits).

Consider the following three usage patterns.  I subscribe to
Deutschland Funk's hourly news cast.  Typically, I'll listen to it in
the afternoon.  I'll only listen if I have a recent episode (at least
published on the same day) and I'll only listen to the newest episode.
I also subscribe a number of talk shows.  I most often listen to these
when I'm on the train, or otherwise waiting for a while.  I don't
necessarily listen to the newest episodes, but I rarely listen to very
old episodes.  Also, I don't necessarily listen to only the newest
downloaded episode: I tend to decide by looking at the topic.
Finally, I also subscribe to a podcast that I listen to serially.

From these scenarios, we can extract some features to help describe
the user's behavior with respect to a given stream.  We can look at
the time between publication and actual use, and the time between
download and actual use.  We can look at the order in which episodes
are used.  Also, we can gage interest by incorporate whether the user
actually listened to a whole file.  If not, did the user at some later
point resume and finish listening to the episode?

Based on good features that summarize the user's behavior, we can
infer a lot about how applications and streams are used and prioritize
what to download and when based on what we think the user is going to
need, the energy budget, the data budget and expected network
coverage.

&gt;<i> Does Woodchuck keep track of all downloads all of the time? What
</I>&gt;<i> influence does this have on memory consumption and performance when
</I>&gt;<i> looking up a given download in a local database?
</I>
Currently, the data is stored in an sqlite database.  The current
implementation aggresively reclaims unused data from memory and
flushes it to the backing store.  I haven't done any benchmarks, but
my intuition is that if these decisions turn out to be a problem, they
can be corrected with some smart software engineering that does not
affect Woodchuck's architecture or even its API.

To be a bit more concrete: consider the size of a podcast vs. the size
of the metadata that Woodchuck is likely to store.  The former is
orders of magnitude larger than the latter.  Once an object is
deleted, its metadata can also be largely removed.  I say largely as
we'll keep aggregate data around to be able to make predictions, e.g.,
the average time between download time and use, its variance, etc.

&gt;<i> Also, does this model take streaming of episodes into account? It's
</I>&gt;<i> basically a simultaneous download + consumption, as far as managing
</I>&gt;<i> network traffic and usage are concerned.
</I>
Woodchuck is targeted at dela-tolerant data sources, i.e., Woodchuck
won't help streaming of live content.  Nevertheless, for the sake of
managing the data budget, Woodchuck tracks data used so as to learn
how much the user consumes and how much is available for speculative
downloading.

If you don't mean live content but simply simultaneously downloading
and watching an episode, that's nothing special to Woodchuck.
Woodchuck interprets this to mean that it should have prefetched the
episode.

&gt;<i> Will Woodchuck be aware of and take into account things like traffic
</I>&gt;<i> limits of 3G connections (e.g. my current plan offers 3GB of traffic per
</I>&gt;<i> month, and the operator charges a premium for every MB above that).
</I>
Absolutely.  Incorporting data budgets is part of the long-term plan.

I don't think this affects the application API, however: this mostly
in a question of the scheduling algorithm.

&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless, gPodder should still report that it was downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (pywoodchuck.object_downloaded) so that Woodchuck can improve its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; model of the user's preferences.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'm interested to hear about some examples what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> preferences these could be and how they could be used to do something
</I>&gt;<i> useful and provide value to the user or application.
</I>
Preferences are properties like how important freshness is for a
particular stream (think news, which becomes uninteresting when a new
episode is released, vs a sitcom, which is normally watched in order).
Woodchuck models these insofar as it tries to infer them from the
user's behavior, rather than requiring the user to manually describe
them, and, moreover, to keep them up to date as the user's interests
change.

&gt;<i> I'm interested in this project, and can see some good use cases, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> also not sure if Woodchuck tries to do too much than what it's supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to do, and if maybe all that micro-mangement of data is really something
</I>&gt;<i> that will be an advantage in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the interesting problems here are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * If and when to download a given file of a certain size
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>  * Priorities for downloads (the user explicitly wants do download
</I>&gt;<i>    something vs. &quot;if I'm on home WiFi + the device is charging + it's
</I>&gt;<i>    3 AM, then also try to download/cache other files&quot;)
</I>
Your example shows how quickly policies can become complicated.  I
don't want to set and maintain such policies for each such application
and stream.

&gt;<i>  * Management of traffic limits (i.e. 3G connection with a limited
</I>&gt;<i>    traffic allowance)
</I>&gt;<i>  * Management of power (i.e. download when on charger, but avoid
</I>&gt;<i>    everything - including feed updates - when the battery goes below a
</I>&gt;<i>    certain threshold)
</I>&gt;<i>  * Awareness of other applications (i.e. don't download if the user is
</I>&gt;<i>    using a web browser, to increase the web browser's responsiveness)
</I>
Yes, yes and yes!  These are all explicitly things that Woodchuck is
trying to support.

&gt;<i>  * Awareness of other machines (i.e. limit the bandwidth if a user on
</I>&gt;<i>    the same network is browsing the web - maybe using
</I>&gt;<i>    Bonjour/Zeroconf?)
</I>
I hadn't considered this before.  My personal experience is that my
N900 is unable to saturate my DSL link.  Moreover, good traffic
shaping policies should minimize the impact of background downloads on
interactive downloads.  (I use 3tos from
<A HREF="http://git.coverfire.com/linux-qos-scripts.git,">http://git.coverfire.com/linux-qos-scripts.git,</A> which works
swimmingly.)  Have you encountered this problem in practice?

&gt;<i>  * Notification interface for &quot;pause all your downloads&quot; / &quot;resume all
</I>&gt;<i>    your download&quot; (i.e. pause download when leaving home and network
</I>&gt;<i>    connectivity changes from WiFi to 3G, etc..)
</I>
This is an interesting idea.  Thanks!  I'll think about how to
integrate it.

&gt;<i> The great thing about this is that we could then have a system-wide
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Download preferences&quot; configuration where the user can configure the
</I>&gt;<i> preferences (e.g. &quot;download even on 3G, because I have a flat rate&quot;) and
</I>&gt;<i> these preferences would be implemented by the Woodchuck policy / daemon
</I>&gt;<i> and automatically used by all the applications.
</I>
Yes!  This is exactly what I plan to implement.  My vision is that
when the user connects to a new network for the first time, a pop up
asks the user to describe the connection's policy, e.g., hard 3 GB per
month, flatrate, X minutes (a common policy at hotels, I've observed),
etc.

Thanks for the great questions and feedback.
