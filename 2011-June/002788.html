<PRE>Hi All,

I'm working on a project (called Woodchuck) to improve download
management.  I'd like gPodder (as well as my RSS reader, my social
network program, my email client, my calendaring program, my weather
widget, etc.) to automatically update and download new content when
convenient, for instance, when my N900 is connected to power, there is
a good WiFi connection and I'm not currently using the device.

I've spent some time reading gPodder's source code, but I'm unsure
what the best approach to integrating Woodchuck into gPodder is.
Should I modify download.py?  Should I add a plug-in using the hook
API?  Should I modify gui.py?

To help you help me, here is a very brief description of Woodchuck's
architecture and intended programming model.

Woodchuck is based on three object types: managers, streams and
objects.  An application registers itself as a manager.  It registers
one stream for each subscription, e.g., podcast feed, and one object
corresponding to each piece of content, e.g., podcast episode.  When
Woodchuck determines that it is a good opportunity to update streams
or objects, it makes an upcall to the application (starting it if
required) indicating which streams to update and which objects to
download.

Woodchuck learns which streams a user users, how (e.g., in a serial
like watching a TV series or only newest, like watching the news) and
in what context the user accesses the objects (think: time and
location).  It then responds appropriately.  To help this learning
process, an application should indicate when objects are used and what
parts (e.g., the first 5 minutes of a 25 minute episode).

You can read more about Woodchuck here:

The python module, pywoodchuck, which I intend to use with gPodder, is
described in detail here:

I'd appreciate any advice you have about integrating Woodchuck into
gPodder.  If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

Neal
