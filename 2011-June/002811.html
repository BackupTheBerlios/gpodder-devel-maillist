<PRE>Hi!

Ever since &quot;Science Friday&quot; switched to unsegmented episodes a few
months back, I've been meaning to try and improve gpodder's handling
of last-played position. I've been slowly working on various aspects
of this, and while it's not yet complete, I figured that I'd report
back on my progress so far.

The purpose of this message is to provide an overview and put things
in context, but I've also opened bug reports for some specific issues.

I vaguely know that the 'tres' branch plans to have a
built-in media player, which may make many of the issues that I'm
raising here less crucial. However, I hope that 'tres' still allows
using external media players as well (one of the things I really
like about gpodder is its adherence to the &quot;unix philosophy&quot; of
&quot;do one thing and do it well&quot;), in which case the points are
still relevant.

Just some background on my &quot;setup&quot;: I run gpodder on my (Linux) desktop
and on my n900. On the desktop, currently, my media player of choice is VLC,
on the n900 I play the media via the n900's native Media
Player. The main use cases I'm interested in
having support for are listening to part of an episode and stopping at
at some point, and later resuming from the same point, possibly from
a different machine.

Basically, there are a few different issues which have to be dealt
with in order to have good last-played position support:

1. last-played position needs to be reported back from the player
   when pausing/stopping.
2. sync of last-played position via my.gpodder.net
3. gpodder needs to tell the player to resume an episode from its
   last-played position

This is where things stand today, as far as I know:

N900:
 (1) works both with the default media player as well as with
     panucci (I don't know what the situation is with any other
     media players). However, about 1/3 of the time, gpodder
     doesn't seem to register the end of an episode. My workaround
     is to just play the last few (more than 5!) seconds again,
     and usually the last-played position is then registered
     correctly. Only now as I'm writing this up have I attempted
     to look into this, and it appears that because the media player
     cycles back to the beginning of the episode when the end is
     reached, that gpodder is receiving a PlaybackStopped
     notification about a segment starting at position x and ending
     at position 0. I'm not sure whether or how gpodder can deal
     with this, in any case, I've opened
<A HREF="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12262">https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12262</A>
     for tracking this.
 (2) works well, but see detailed discussion of this point later on.
 (3) works flawlessly for me with the default media player. I believe
     that this is acheived by gpodder telling the media player
     where to resume using mafw's D-Bus API, so this solution is
     specific to the n900/mafw.

Desktop (Linux):

As I've mentioned, VLC is currently my media player of choice. I've
tried using panucci, but there are some features which I use regularly
which panucci doesn't have (e.g., application-specific volume control).
So most of what I discuss here is relevant to VLC (and probably most
media players), though I will also discuss how panucci fits in in some
cases.

 (1) Only panucci reports back the last-played position using gpodder's
     Media Player D-Bus API. I've started looking into writing a VLC
     plugin to do this, and it actually looks like it shouldn't be very
     difficult, but I'm new to VLC and the going is slow... So for now,
     the only &quot;last-played&quot; information available to gpodder on the
     desktop is that coming from my.gpodder.net. However, that's good
     enough for discussing some further points.
 (2) Sync of last-played information with my.gpodder.net seems to work
     well, though there are a few issues:
     - On my desktop, unlike on my n900, I set gpodder to
       automatically delete old played episodes. Now, I have a backlog
       of episodes, so it often happens that I start listening to an
       episode after a few days, at which time it is already &quot;old&quot;.
       The problem is, if I've started playing it on the n900, and
       stopped somewhere in the middle, it is already marked as &quot;played&quot;,
       and therefore when I startup gpodder on my desktop it syncs,
       receives the information that the event has been played, and
       immediately deletes it (again, if it's old enough, which it often
       is). My suggested solution is to have a preference setting to
       allow specifying whether or not &quot;played but unfinished&quot; events
       should be deleted. I Opened <A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363</A>
       for this, with an initial patch.
     - Although the sync works and last-played position is received,
       the desktop GUI doesn't provide any feedback about last-played
       position. Such feedback would be very helpful even just by itself
       (even if I don't have any resume support, I could still manually
       move to the last played position when I start listening); and
       also makes it easier to understand what's going on when extending
       the support. I've opened <A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1364">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1364</A>
       for this, again with some patches (they're very basic: they're
       functional, but not very &quot;pretty&quot; in terms of the GUI-design).
    Once this information is visible, I've noticed a few more issues:
    - It seems that the desktop is not immediately receiving the desired
      information: in other words, I'd get home while listening to an
      episode, sync my n900 with my.gpodder.net, then sync my desktop
      with my.gpodder.net, but the episode I'd been listening to wouldn't
      be synced, even though the action was already visible on the Web
      Service. Only after a couple of hours would that information be
      received. After investigating, it turned out that there's a bug
      where gpodder is sending action updates with the local time, rather
      than with UTC time, as required by the API. So first of all, I've
      added a patch which fixes this to the existing bug report
      <A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1036">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1036</A> against gpodder
      (though I can't seem to reopen it myself). Secondly, I'm wondering
      whether it may not make sense for the Web Service to be more
      tolerant of this (same as the Web UI is)? Should I open an issue
      against the web service for this?
    - A related issue: I'm not clear enough about when actions are synced
      to the web service. It's less of an issue with the desktop, which
      is always connected, but with the n900, when does a sync happen?
      Does it happen at startup, even if I don't check for new episodes?
      What if gpodder was started while I wasn't connected, will a sync
      happen as soon as a network becomes available? Perhaps it would be
      nice to have an explicit button for syncing with my.gpodder.net,
      separately from episode updates (I've been assuming that certainly
      when I check for new episodes then a sync will happen, but is this
      in fact true?).
 (3) Support for resuming at last-played position, as far as I can tell,
     does not exist at all on the desktop. Even with panucci, where this
     appears to work, it's actaully panucci which is remembering the
     last played position. So if, for example, I start listening on my
     n900, sync so that the desktop gpodder knows that I've listened
     until position x, and then try to resume from my desktop gpodder
     via panucci, it will start at the beginning again.
     There's actually an existing this
(<A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1140">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1140</A>).
     I've added a very initial patch there, which allows for providing
     a start position on a custom command line. It works for me with VLC
     (though things get more complicated when combining it with
     enqueueing, or starting multiple episodes at once). So for me the
     patch is useful even in its current form (and is totally optional),
     but it's not yet complete. I wonder if anyone has any thoughts on
     other ways to acheive &quot;resume&quot; functionality in a fairly generic
     way...

One additional idea I've had, and am interested in hearing feedback, is
to create a standalone application which would stand between gpodder
and the media players, would talk with gpodder via the Media Player
D-Bus API and the command line, and then talk with different media
players via their own APIs. That would allow gpodder to have only
simple, generic, APIs, and move the complexity of dealing with
different media players to a separate, isolated, layer. Any thoughts?

Anyhow, this was rather long, but I'd be happy to hear any feedback, and
I hope that the patches which are mature enough can be applied as is.

Thanks!
Dov
