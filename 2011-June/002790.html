Woodchuck isn't so much about performing downloads as it is about
scheduling them.  That is, Woodchuck's primary goal is to determine
when it is a good time to download data and which data to download.
(That said, it does provide a simple downloader for objects accessible
over http and https.)

As gPodder should not depend on Woodchuck (at least not until
Woodchuck becomes widely adopted) and as gPodder's download
functionality already works, I intend to only hook gPodder up to
Woodchuck's scheduling frame work when Woodchuck is available.

&gt;<i> My understanding is that there would need to be an API to queue an URL
</I>&gt;<i> for downloading,
</I>
Right.  The basic idea is that gPodder registers a stream for each
podcast subscription (pywoodchuck.stream_register).  At some point,
Woodchuck makes an upcall telling gPodder that it is a good time to
update one or more streams (pywoodchuck.stream_update_cb).  (If
gPodder is not running, Woodchuck first starts it using
org.freedesktop.DBus.StartServiceByName.)  gPodder then updates the
feeds and reports whether the update was successful
(pywoodchuck.stream_updated).  For each new episode, gPodder registers
a new object (pywoodchuck.object_register).

At some point (perhaps immediately), Woodchuck tells gPodder to
download some objects (pywoodchuck.object_download_cb).  gPodder then
downloads the objects and reports success or the type of failure
(pywoodchuck.object_downloaded).

When the user listens to a podcast, gPodder reports this to Woodchuck
(pywoodchuck.object_used).  That way, Woodchuck can learn the user's
preferences.

If the user wants to listen to a podcast episode and it is not
downloaded, gPodder can still download it in the usual fashion.
Nevertheless, gPodder should still report that it was downloaded
(pywoodchuck.object_downloaded) so that Woodchuck can improve its
model of the user's preferences.

&gt;<i> get asynchronous updates and pause/cancel specific
</I>&gt;<i> file, maybe pop up a settings dialog.
</I>
I'm not sure what you have in mind here.  Could you elaborate?

&gt;<i>  The rest would be done by an
</I>&gt;<i> external module which would use Woodchuck on Maemo,
</I>
Right.

&gt;<i> something else on desktop,
</I>
There is no reason that Woodchuck cannot also be used on the Desktop.

&gt;<i> gPodder would have a local implementation based on download.py, in
</I>&gt;<i> case the external module does not exist.
</I>
Right.  I figure that that could be done in a similar way to how
gPodder handles DBus when it is missing--an empty implementation.
