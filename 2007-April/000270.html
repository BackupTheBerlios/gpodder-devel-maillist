<PRE>Hello, Nick!

Thanks, I can't test video, so I'm glad you added these fixes. Hopefully
this makes video podcasts better supported on iPods..

&gt;<i> If you now go into the gPodder sync properties tab there is an option
</I>&gt;<i> to sync only unplayed episodes (which was a great idea, I'm now using
</I>&gt;<i> it!). I had to add a bit to your patch so that you can still add
</I>&gt;<i> episodes to the device while &quot;only sync unplayed ...&quot; is on. This can
</I>&gt;<i> be achieved by selecting the episode you want to add and clicking the
</I>&gt;<i> transfer button. The played episodes aren't synced only when you do a
</I>&gt;<i> full synchronization (CTRL + s). 
</I>
Sounds good to me.

&gt;<i> The set_podcast_flags function in libipodsync it would overwrite all
</I>&gt;<i> the mediatype settings to audio 0x00000004, so when you would sync
</I>&gt;<i> again after adding a video it would no longer show up as a video. I
</I>&gt;<i> just moved that code to where the video detection takes place.
</I>&gt;<i> track.mediatype doesn't need to be reset each time a sync takes place.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> Also, I set the videos filetype to m4v instead of everything as mp3,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems to have fixed a random bug where some of my videos would be
</I>&gt;<i> still regarded as audio (but this might not be necessary, my ipod
</I>&gt;<i> could just be crazy).
</I>
Do .mov files (if they even work on an iPod?) also work when this is set
to m4v?

&gt;<i> Lastly, I made it so that torrent files couldn't be transferred to
</I>&gt;<i> devices, I don't see why you'd need torrent files on a media device. 
</I>
I've changed that part so that it doesn't check for &quot;isn't torrent&quot;, but
instead checks for &quot;is audio or video&quot;. That should solve problems with
feeds that provide other kinds of files (I think I've seen a podcast
feed with a PDF transcript recently..).

Please apply the attached patch to your working copy (r313) and tell me
if it works as expected. I'll commit it to svn then.


Thanks for your work,
Thomas
