<PRE>Hi,

Version 0.8.9 is an old version of gPodder, the most recent one is v0.9.0. 
However, v0.9.0 doesn't contain a fix for this so you'll have to wait for 
v0.9.1 to come out.

There is a bugfix available though, but it's only available in the SVN 
version, which might be unstable sometimes (but it has worked fine for me 
until now).

Here's how to install it:
- Install SVN. On Ubuntu, do the command 'sudo apt-get install svn' in a 
terminal (without the quotes)
- Open a terminal if you haven't already done so. 'cd' to the directory where 
you want to store the SVN version of gPodder (for 
example: /home/pdedecker/Desktop). Don't make the program folder itself yet, 
we'll do that in just a second.
- Enter the command 'svn co <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk</A> 
gpodder' (without the quotes). Wait for the download to finish, SVN is now 
downloading the development version of gPodder.
- When done, 'cd' to the program directory. Do 'make test'. gPodder should 
start now.

You can also create a shortcut to gPodder if you want. Create a new shortcut 
in KDE/GNOME, choose to enter the path to the program by yourself and locate 
the gPodder executable (it's in gpodder/bin). Behind the program path, 
type --local --verbose. It should look something like this:
/home/pdedecker/Desktop/gpodderSVN/bin/gpodder --local --verbose

If you want to upgrade gPodder SVN, go to the directory where you keep it 
using the 'cd' command (for me, that's /home/pdedecker/Desktop/gpodderSVN/) 
and execute the command 'svn update' (again, without the quotes).
If you decide to remove gPodder SVN, just remove the gpodder folder.

Good luck! If you still have questions, just send them to the mailing list.
