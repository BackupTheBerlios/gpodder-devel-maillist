I've tried to download the most recent episode (quite an adventure on
64k ;) and found gPodder react the way you reported. I've fixed this bug
by filtering non-enclosure items earlier in the parsing process, so
gPodder will now never &quot;see&quot; non-enclosure items (as opposed to omitting
it in the display, which was the default behaviour until now). Check out
the latest svn revision with this bug fixed :)

&gt;<i> But the main problem occurs with other podcasts then. gpodder starts 
</I>&gt;<i> downloading them and as soon as they reach 100%, the progress bar
</I>&gt;<i> jumps back to 0% and nothing happens. Sometimes I also can't use the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;quit&quot; button than any more.
</I>&gt;<i> If I restart gpodder, it happens again, and I can't download any new
</I>&gt;<i> episodes. It only worked again when I deleted the bad podcast.
</I>
Can you please enable wget log output by removing the &quot;#&quot; in the line

             #log( 'wget&gt; %s', msg)

in libwget.py and then run &quot;make test&quot; in your working copy and send me
the console output of gpodder when this error occurs? Can this error be
reliably reproduced? Does is happen on specific podcasts, but not on
others?

Thanks,
Thomas
