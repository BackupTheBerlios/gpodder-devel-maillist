Ok, I looked it over and made a few changes.
I really like the idea of using Gnome BitTorrent to download files, I'm glad 
you thought of that. The reason why I made gpodder move the files to a folder 
is very specific to me which I realize is wrong but let me explain.

I have a BitTorrent server running Azureus, the way I get new torrents into it 
is via a command that works with firefox/konqueror/etc to move the torrent 
file to a specific folder on my nfs server. From there the BitTorrent server 
picks up the file and downloads it! (I know one other person that does it 
this way, I can only imagine there are more)

So I added a way to choose what the torrent save folder is used for, either to 
save the actual .torrent files or as the save the dir for Gnome BitTorrent. 
It's all explained to the user in the radiobutton's tooltip.

I also made sure that all the files that are copied have a .torrent extention 
(otherwise Azureus ignores them) and made sure the torrent files are all 
chmod'ed so everyone has read/write permission to them. That is also because 
if they aren't Azureus might have trouble deleting them. (It's a good thing 
that it's able to delete them.)

Tell me what you think! :-D
