<PRE>Thanks for the replies - yes - I do have ipod selected and not file
based player. I have installed python-pymad and python-gpod. Problem not
solved yet.

I restored my ipod (erased all settings and music off it) in windows and
then tried again with gpodder and still nothing comes through onto the
menus. I can see all of the podcasts are on the ipod as .mp3's in the
Ipod_Control/Music folder. So it seems to be an issue with the meta data
file being written.

I am also having another issue related to the program itself. Gpodder
seems to stop downloading and hang part way through a download sequence
- often when there are 10 to 15 simultaneous downloads. I then have to
cancel all of those downloads and start them again. Any ideas?

Many thanks for your assistance.

Darren
