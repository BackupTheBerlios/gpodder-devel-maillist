I've implemented basic playback history support in the latest svn
revision. Please try it out and tell me if it works for you. What you
get:

* Enable &quot;Played&quot; column in the Advanced tab of the Properties dialog
* Playback files on your computer - the &quot;Played&quot; column will show a 
  green dot
* Sync to your iPod - played back files shouldn't have a blue dot 
  anymore
* Play back files on your iPod, then sync with gPodder - gPodder should
  update the played back status of the podcasts accordingly

This also works with older iPods (tested with iPod mini), and uses the
playcount as a &quot;played&quot; indicator. Don't know if playcount increase
means a fully played episode or just the start of the playback - test on
your iPod.

&gt;<i> BTW - I can probably contribute .deb packaging for the upcoming Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> release, let me know if you would be interested. 
</I>
It'd be great if you could work towards getting gPodder into the Ubuntu
repositories. You might want to start from the Debian package I'm
currently working on. A bit older version can be found on [1], but if
you're interested, I can send you the latest .deb source files.

Enjoy,
