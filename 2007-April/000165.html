Correct, I've forgotten to mark these strings as translatable. This has
been fixed in current svn, and you should be able to update the
translation file accordingly and send in a patch (&quot;svn diff &gt;
patchfile&quot;)

&gt;<i> I also want to report a minor annoyance. Every time I start gPodder, I

I've looked into this issue and have made the following changes to
(hopefully) fit your needs and make all users a bit happier:

* Window size and position of the gPodder main window are now saved on
close and restored on startup, so you don't have to resize the gPodder
main window all the time if you're used to working with a bigger gPodder
window

* The episode title column is always auto-sized so that the text fits
into it; as long as you don't resize it manually, it will resize
automatically on channel switches. If you start resizing it manually, it
will keep the set width until gPodder is closed. Hope that's what you
wanted to accomplish :)


Enjoy,
Thomas
