<PRE>I've got a strange issue with one of my feeds.  If I download a podcast
and check it the next day.  The downloaded one is at the bottom of the
list.  It is also near the top of the list, where it would be expected
to be but appears as a new podcast to be downloaded.  For some reason it
is not associating the downloaded podcast with the one in the list.

The only thing that really stands out on this particular one is that it
is subscription based.  Access is controlled via http auth.  I have my
feed setup like <A HREF="http://user:pass@url.">http://user:pass@url.</A>  This may or may not be related.

I'd like to work on a patch if someone can quickly tell me how it
associates downloaded files with xml items.

Thanks,
-Jon
