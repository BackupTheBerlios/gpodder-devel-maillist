Should be no problem if the RSS feed adds the authentication data to the
links of your podcast.

</I>
gPodder defines episodes as unique by their download URL, because the
same URL will always retrieve the same content. The problem with your
feed can have two causes I can think of from the top of my head:

* Session ID is passed through the URL
* Load balancing changes the URL on every update (mirrors)

It would be nice if you could send me the RSS file in question (you can
obfuscate the domain part of the URL and replace any authentication data
that might be in the URLs). Please, send me one copy of the RSS file
when you're downloading files and then send me another copy when the
problem you described appears. The RSS files can be found in
~/.config/gpodder/cache/.


Thanks,
Thomas
