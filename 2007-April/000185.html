gPodder uses libgpod's Python bindings to access the iPod. The library
can actually do most things iTunes can do (don't know about &quot;advanced&quot;
features like videos or photos of new iPods, as I only have an iPod
mini, but for that it works great). You're right with saying that Apple
hasn't given out any information about the iTunesDB structure and
libgpod is entirely(?) based on reverse-engineering (as far as I
know ;).

As far as libgpod is concerned, the features Stephan describes are
surely possible with the current release. I've already written some code
this moring to integrate the said features into gPodder, and I'll
clean-up the code and commit it to the svn repository sometime this
afternoon. I'll let you know about that in the reply to the OP's mail
then.


Thanks,
Thomas
