I've looked at your patch and refined it. I'm not a torrent downloader,
but I've tested a feed from revision3.com. Basically, this downloads
the .torrent file and then calls &quot;gnome-btdownload&quot; with the torrent and
the torrent filename (thanks to your code ;) and saves the real file in
the selected torrent download folder. Please have a look if this would
work eventually. Of course, we should make the torrent client
configurable later.

Basically, you can download the .torrent and gPodder then starts
gnome-btdownload as soon as the torrent is downloaded. You can close
down gnome-btdownload and continue the download later by clicking on the
torrent in gPodder's main window and click on &quot;download&quot; (which opens
gnome-btdownload and continues the download).

I've included the patch, as I'm not yet sure if this is what a torrent
user would expect from gPodder - I need your feedback :)

&gt;<i> I've also been working on automatic updating and automatic downloading
</I>&gt;<i> of new shows but I can't seem to get it to work. I know it's because
</I>&gt;<i> of the way threading works in gPodder, I just can't figure it out. 
</I>
Nice :) As always, just send the patch in when you think it's ready,
I'll have a look at it =)


Enjoy,
Thomas
