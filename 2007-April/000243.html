Could you try running &quot;gpodder --verbose&quot; and do a sync. Then paste your 
terminal's output to the list (or pastebin.ca if there's a lot). 

Also what version of libgpod are you using? 
On an rpm based distro you can find out via something like this: 
&quot;rpm -qa | grep gpod&quot; 
and on a deb based distro find out via something like this: 
&quot;dpkg -l | grep gpod&quot;

For the downloads problem I'm not quite sure, have you tried looking at top 
(or htop) while it's downloading? 15 wget instances on a slow machine is a 
lot of work!
