<PRE>Okay, I have libgpod0 version 0.3.2-1.1ubuntu1 installed. I do not have
libgpod-dev installed. python-gpod installed is version 0.3.2-1.1ubuntu1
as well. gpodder is 0.9.1-1

Really don't know what top or htop is. Using latest ubuntu distro. It is
a slower machine I am running on. My internet is not super snappy
either. Any way I can limit the concurrent downloads to say three or
four?

Thanks again for the help. This is the first time I have troubleshot
something in a community fashion. It is very cool. Liking Linux more and
more.

There does look like some interesting stuff below. I deleted one
repetitive section Gpodder actually crashed at the end of the sync. This
is what it was saying:

Thanks,
Darren

</I>&gt;<i> Could you try running &quot;gpodder --verbose&quot; and do a sync. Then paste your 
</I>&gt;<i> terminal's output to the list (or pastebin.ca if there's a lot). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also what version of libgpod are you using? 
</I>&gt;<i> On an rpm based distro you can find out via something like this: 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rpm -qa | grep gpod&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> and on a deb based distro find out via something like this: 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dpkg -l | grep gpod&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the downloads problem I'm not quite sure, have you tried looking at top 
</I>&gt;<i> (or htop) while it's downloading? 15 wget instances on a slow machine is a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of work!
