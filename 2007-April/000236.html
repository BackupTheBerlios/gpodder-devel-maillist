<PRE>Hello again,

After some initial testing I can report back that gpodder seems to behave
correctly when it comes to detecting which podcasts have been played
(according to gtkpod).

Unfortunately there seems to be an issue with gtkpod (or some underlying
library). Although a track gets played it does not always get marked as a
&quot;playcount +1&quot;. It seems to be related to &quot;finishing a track&quot; (ie -
listening to the end) as opposed to just actually playing it. Instead of a
playcount it seems that it is a &quot;finishing count&quot;. I will try and track this
further and report back.

Kind regards,
Stephan
