</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I added your patch and fixed some libipodsync bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, I can't test video, so I'm glad you added these fixes. Hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> this makes video podcasts better supported on iPods..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you now go into the gPodder sync properties tab there is an option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to sync only unplayed episodes (which was a great idea, I'm now using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it!). I had to add a bit to your patch so that you can still add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; episodes to the device while &quot;only sync unplayed ...&quot; is on. This can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be achieved by selecting the episode you want to add and clicking the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer button. The played episodes aren't synced only when you do a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; full synchronization (CTRL + s).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The set_podcast_flags function in libipodsync it would overwrite all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the mediatype settings to audio 0x00000004, so when you would sync
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again after adding a video it would no longer show up as a video. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just moved that code to where the video detection takes place.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; track.mediatype doesn't need to be reset each time a sync takes place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I set the videos filetype to m4v instead of everything as mp3,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it seems to have fixed a random bug where some of my videos would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still regarded as audio (but this might not be necessary, my ipod
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could just be crazy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do .mov files (if they even work on an iPod?) also work when this is set
</I>&gt;<i> to m4v?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lastly, I made it so that torrent files couldn't be transferred to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; devices, I don't see why you'd need torrent files on a media device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've changed that part so that it doesn't check for &quot;isn't torrent&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> instead checks for &quot;is audio or video&quot;. That should solve problems with
</I>&gt;<i> feeds that provide other kinds of files (I think I've seen a podcast
</I>&gt;<i> feed with a PDF transcript recently..).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please apply the attached patch to your working copy (r313) and tell me
</I>&gt;<i> if it works as expected. I'll commit it to svn then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your work,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas

Works perfect. I tried a .mov file tonight (from rocketboom.com), it synced 
without an issue and ended up in the proper location on the iPod.

Commit when ready!
