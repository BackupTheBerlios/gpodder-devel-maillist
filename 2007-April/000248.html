The problem is that libgpod is too old, the latest version is 0.4.2 .
I would recommend uninstalling all of your libgpod related packages and 
install the new version by following the instructions found on this page:
<A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/dependencies.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/dependencies.html</A> If you have any problems 
whatsoever doing this feel free to ask and we'll give you a hand.

Hehe, you &quot;were&quot; using the latest Ubuntu distro. The newest one (to be 
released April 19th) is 7.04 (A.K.A. Feisty Fawn) which is available as a 
beta now and includes libgpod 0.4.2 .
FYI top and htop are process monitors, I'd recommend htop it's a fancier 
version of top. It'll tell you what your computer is doing (how much 
cpu/ram/swap is being used and by what processes).

That is my favorite part of the whole FOSS community, we as the users are 
constantly helping to make the software better by interacting directly with 
the developers.

&gt;<i> There does look like some interesting stuff below. I deleted one

I think this was the most telling of all the warnings: 
(ipodsync) Seems like your python-gpod is out-of-date.
