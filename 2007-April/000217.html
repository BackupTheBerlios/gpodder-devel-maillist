<PRE>I added some basic support for rss feeds with torrents in them (like feeds 
from revision3.com). It basically copies BitTorrent files to another 
directory where they can be picked up by programs like Azureus. Perhaps in 
the future support could be added to run a script to start a download for a 
torrent but for now this will work with clients that support directory 
monitoring.

The selector for choosing where to copy the torrent files to is in the 
downloads section of the preferences window.
The torrent recognition is done in a rather crude way but I think it'll work 
fine, have a look yourself, I can't think of another way to do it. Looking 
for a file extention is out of the question because certain sites like 
mininova.org that don't use extentions for their filenames.

I've also been working on automatic updating and automatic downloading of new 
shows but I can't seem to get it to work. I know it's because of the way 
threading works in gPodder, I just can't figure it out. 

Anywho, one step at a time,

nick

P.S. The patch is against today's svn (rev 309 I think)
P.P.S. I know there are plugins for azureus that'll do similar to this but I 
like gPodder much better for managing my media-related rss feeds.
