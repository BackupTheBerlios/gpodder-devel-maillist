Great idea. This has been an itch I have wanted to scratch for some
years but don't have the Python skills.

A while ago I wrote a Perl script which fixes missing album names in the
way you suggest, but I also added a regex matching capability so that I
could generate album names based on the filename. This was for feeds
that contain different podcast &quot;streams&quot;. I also added an episode title
modification facility so that I could ensure the episodes sorted
correctly on my Samsung player. If I have several episodes to listen to
I want them to play in the right order, and my player only seems to be
able to sort them alphabetically.

I also like to compress titles so an episode number or date is easily
visible.

I can see there being many types of parsing and restructuring that could
be carried out. It could all get rather complex, but I think it's well
worth doing.

Dave
