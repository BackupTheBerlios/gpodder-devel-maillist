<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I also have some (minor) issues with sync'ing to an iPod (a
</I>&gt;<i> 5th generation nano). In all cases, you can start gpodder
</I>&gt;<i> from the command line with the '--verbose' option, that will
</I>&gt;<i> give you more output to identify problems.
</I>
Thanks, should have thought of that *slapsforehead*

&gt;<i> This usually means that the ipod is not mounted at the
</I>&gt;<i> point where gpodder expects it to be. gpodder uses a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hard-coded&quot; path for the ipod, but it may be that UDEV/HAL
</I>&gt;<i> assigns a different name. For example, my USB thumbdrive is
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes mounted as &quot;/media/disk&quot; and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/media/disk-1&quot;. I cannot find any pattern in these
</I>
&gt;<i> occurences, but something similar may happen to your ipod.
</I>Pretty sure I checked for that the last couple of times, but I'll check again it happens the next time.

&gt;<i> I have the same thing happening. In my case, all episodes
</I>&gt;<i> will be transferred, they show up in rhythmbox, but when I
</I>&gt;<i> disconnect the ipod will say &quot;0 podcasts&quot;. If I re-connect,
</I>&gt;<i> view in rhythmbox and then eject from rhythmbox, the ipods
</I>&gt;<i> are playable.
</I>
Had one of those cases today again. Thanks to --verbose I saw gPodder complaining about not finding the iTunesDB, even though the path it gave (/media/IPOD/iPod_Control/iTunes/iTunesDB) is correct and I did find this file there with dolphin.
As you said the files show up in rhythmbox, although simply looking at them and then ejecting the iPod didn't make a difference for me.
I noticed that (unlike those I put on the iPod under iTunes in Windows) the Genre was &quot;unknown&quot; and they did not have a track number. Rhythmbox would not let me edit the tags on the iPod so I pulled one of the files (a Linux Outlaws episode) into the rhythmbox music library. Rhythmbox automatically assigned it the genre &quot;Podcast&quot; and a track number. I pushed it back on the device and ejected the iPod. This episode did not appear on the iPod, but what did appear are 39 copies of Tech News Today #114. Which is the correct amount (I copied the #76 -#114), but obviously I'd rather have the 39 episodes instead of the copies. 

All in all an interesting experiment that left me even more confused than before :)

So Long
Manuel

&gt;<i> I have not been able to tell any error from the gpodder
</I>&gt;<i> output. I blame it on libgpod (or whatever other software is
</I>&gt;<i> used to transfer files to the ipod). Also note that if you
</I>&gt;<i> have a completely fresh Gen-V Nano, you can transfer files
</I>&gt;<i> with rhythmbox or gpodder, and nothing will show up on the
</I>&gt;<i> player, although rhythmbox will list the files. In that
</I>&gt;<i> case, you must connect the ipod to iTunes, and (re)set to
</I>&gt;<i> factory setting, and transfer at least one file. After that,
</I>&gt;<i> it will work fine with gpodder or rhythmbox. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the database system on the ipod is complicated and
</I>&gt;<i> prone to sync'ing errors. Just the way Apple wants it to
</I>&gt;<i> be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Wilfred
</I>
