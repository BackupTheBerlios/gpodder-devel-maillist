<PRE>Hi folks! 

I'm having trouble syncing to my 4th generation iPod Nano. I start gPodder and let it download episodes, connect the iPod and look at it with dolphin to make sure its mounted properly and at the mountpoint I expect it to be etc. but when I try to move podcasts to it weird things happen:
 ~ 50% of the time gPodder tells me that it can't open the device and to &#8220;check my preferences&#8221; (real helpful if it doesn't tell me what to look for).
~30% it starts syncing to the iPod and I can see the files in dolphin in the file system but when I disconnect the iPod and try to play them they just don't show up (ie the podcast folder is empty, although it does tell me that the amount of free space has gone down the appropriate amount -&gt; the episodes are somewhere on the device, I just can't access them.) if I connect the iPod to iTunes back on Windows it tells that it can't access the device and resets it to factory defaults. 
~15% it will transfer files, when I open the podcast folder there is just one podcast folder inside (should be several), the displayed cover art is of one of the podcast I put on there (I think it was always the Twit cover art, but I'm not 100% sure there) but the name of the podcast is always &#8220;Root&#8221;. Inside there is the  correct episode and I can play it, but the other podcasts are missing (ie I transfered ~ 40 episodes from 4-5 different podcasts, only the twit one shows up). Again iTunes will reset the iPod to factory default.
~5% it simply works. I can listen to the episodes on it but when I come back home and reconnect to get new ones I run a high risk of getting it fubared again.
Syncing from rhythmbox works fine (haven't tried any other).
Anybody seen this before or know whats going on here?


So Long
Manuel
