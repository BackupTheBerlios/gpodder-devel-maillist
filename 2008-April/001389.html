Well, I don't really have the time to implement this functionality, but
maybe some users might find this feature interesting, so if you want to
see it in gPodder, you're only three steps away from getting what you
want:

 * File a bug on <A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/">http://bugs.gpodder.org/</A> so we can track the
   evolution of this feature in a single, central location
 * Start working on the feature, posting screenshots and patches
   to the bug page (be sure to always patch/develop against the
   latest SVN release!)
 * Be prepared to get your patch reviewed and to work in the
   feedback into your patch, until it is ready to be included

After the patch has been accepted, it would be nice if you could keep an
eye on the functionality and make sure bugs reported against the feature
get fixed. This is not a strict requirement, but all of us would like to
have a stable, working gPodder version running on their machine :)

Oh, yes: If you don't know already, there are instructions how to get up
and running with the development version:

<A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/running-from-svn">http://bugs.gpodder.org/running-from-svn</A>

Of course, there are many talented people here on the mailing list that
are already familiar with the code base and help you around.


Thanks,
Thomas
