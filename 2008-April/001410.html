Read <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/faq,">http://wiki.gpodder.org/faq,</A> especially &quot;What about these odd
directory and file names that look like MD5 sums?&quot;

&gt;<i> I would prefer to have a SPEAKING Directory-Name (eg the website which

</I>&gt;<i> by title and date.

If you look at the roadmap at <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/roadmap">http://wiki.gpodder.org/roadmap</A> you'll see
that we are planning to do this for the release in late May 2008. The
corresponding bug report can be found here:
<A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57">http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57</A>

You can subscribe to the bug to get notified of any changes and progress
made on this feature.

If you want do have this feature right away, you can get the SVN version
of gPodder (<A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/running-from-svn">http://wiki.gpodder.org/running-from-svn</A>) and edit
src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py and change the &quot;get_filename&quot; function of
podcastChannel to &quot;return self.title&quot;. Then, go to the &quot;local_filename&quot;
function of podcastItem and change the &quot;return&quot; statement to the
following line:

return os.path.join( self.channel.save_dir, self.sync_filename() +
extension)

This should give you folders named like the title of the podcast and
files named with the title or whatever you set as &quot;custom sync name&quot; in
the preferences (you will see this setting when switching your syncing
device to &quot;MP3 player&quot;). There you can also set it to use the filename
of the linked file, if you prefer this one.

Be aware that this is a custom modification and a future version of
gPodder might name files and directories a bit different, so it might be
that your downloaded podcasts cannot be found by newer versions of
gPodder. This can be fixed by renaming the files then. It will work for
now :)


Enjoy,
Thomas
