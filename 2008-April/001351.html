<PRE>Hello!

That's nice of you :) Didn't think about English-speaking users having
problems with Amazon.de, as I thought they could probably switch to
Amazon.com or another English-speaking Amazon site. Just tried it and it
seems like they're really all separate. Anyway, I've found this page
that might be helpful (Amazon.de for English-speaking users):

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=505532">http://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=505532</A>

If you don't want to go through the hassle, you can PayPal to
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpodder-devel">thp at perli.net.</A> Thanks for your support!

&gt;<i> (b) Not all podcasts got synced. Episodes with a yellow star seem to
</I>&gt;<i> have been ignored. Any idea why?
</I>
If you mean this icon with the &quot;yellow star&quot;, it means that this episode
is &quot;new in the feed&quot;, i.e. you have to download it first, so it gets a
icon that looks like a file (music, audio, document - depending on which
file you downloaded):

<A HREF="http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/8016/iconstocknewli3.png">http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/8016/iconstocknewli3.png</A>

&gt;<i>From a usability point of view, do you think that the &quot;yellow star&quot; icon
</I>is misleading and looks like the episode is already downloaded? Maybe we
should use a icon that has a yellow star (or something that means &quot;new&quot;)
on it, but no &quot;file&quot; icon, so people can understand better that the
&quot;file&quot; is not on their computer, but that the item is &quot;new&quot;?

&gt;<i> (c) syncing in the GUI did not work: the whole gpodder interface just 
</I>&gt;<i> froze up. But the command line gpodder --sync worked well.
</I>
Which iPod are you using? Can you please post the console output when
running gpodder with the &quot;--verbose&quot; switch, i.e. open a terminal and
enter:

gpodder --verbose 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee ~/Desktop/gpodder-log.txt

Try to reproduce the bug and then post the &quot;gpodder-log.txt&quot; file that
should appear on your Desktop. Before posting, make you you check the
logfile for any sensitive information (if any) and remove/anonymize it
from the logfile, if you think it's irrelevant for the bug.


Thanks,
Thomas
