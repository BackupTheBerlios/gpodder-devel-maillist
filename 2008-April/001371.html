Maybe you can install python2.5 and use Python 2.5 for gPodder? It
should work with python2.4, and I don't know if it makes any difference,
but you could try (I'm using Python 2.5 here, for example).

Should be recent enough.

&gt;<i> &gt; Have you been successfully using the sync feature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, never had any problem until now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When did this bug start to happen? Did you do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything special?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday after running 'svn up' in de gpodder dir. I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't do anything special as far as I can tell.
</I>
Yeah, and you said when reverting to the version before the Maemo
changes you also see the same problems?

&gt;<i> &gt; Does it only affect the sync modules or also other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parts of gPodder?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to only happen on sync, and then it seems
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to happen if I sync more than 1 file at a
</I>&gt;<i> time. I've tested a bit today. Sync'ing just 1 file at
</I>&gt;<i> a time is more stable (i.e. causes less frequent
</I>&gt;<i> freezes) than sync'ing more than 1 file at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> Sync'ing more than 1 at a time fails more often than
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it only happens on sync, does it happen with both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iPod and MP3 player
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sync?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I always sync to an file-based MP3 player (it is an
</I>&gt;<i> ipod, but running rockbox - it's just an external
</I>&gt;<i> hard-drive for gpodder).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Until now I've never had any issues with the sync in
</I>&gt;<i> gpodder. The error message 'Xlib ...' seems so cryptic
</I>&gt;<i> to me that I suspect it doesn't come from gpodder
</I>&gt;<i> itself but rather from somewhere deep within either
</I>&gt;<i> python or pygtk.
</I>
Please apply the enclosed patch to your SVN checkout (it disables the UI
status updates to the sync dialog) and try to reproduce the bug. I
suspect that maybe the faster UI updates in the MP3 player sync code
could cause this problem, but as I said, it's only a guess :)

Thanks,
Thomas
