<PRE>Hello!

This is being handled over at <A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91">http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91</A>
and we already have a possible icon for &quot;new episodes&quot;, thanks to Mark,
who has done some research.

</I>
Which kind of GUI actions do you mean? Is this worse compared to older
releases? At least the startup should be a bit faster (even faster in
SVN, I presume). Adding downloads might be slow, yes. Should have a look
into that. Maybe you want to file a bug over at bugs.gpodder.org?

&gt;<i> =&gt; this results in a series of user actions that may crash the program

</I>&gt;<i> * the program crashes sometimes when selecting individual episodes for

</I>
Can you reproduce these bugs? They surely don't happen here. Are you
using the SVN version or the released version? Does running gpodder with
the &quot;--verbose&quot; flag give any hints when it's crashing?

&gt;<i> P.S.: The gPodder project is one of the best managed FOSS projects I

</I>
I'm glad you like it :)


Thanks,
Thomas
