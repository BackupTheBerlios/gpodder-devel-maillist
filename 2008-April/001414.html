<PRE>All,

I've been experiencing a &quot;gpodder is slow&quot; problem for a month or two now
and have lived with it (at one point my feed list contained over 100
podcasts so I thought that possibly had something to do with it). However,
recently, despite trimming down my list slightly gpodder's gui can still be
extremely unresponsive and slow.

After starting gpodder with a blank feed list I discovered that the problem
only seems to appear once the feed list gets to around 30/35 podcasts.
Before that, there is a slight delay in gui updates but only by a matter of
a second or two. After this number the delay increases.

I did initially think it was only when downloading podcasts and it was the
act of updating the downloading list/status that was causing the problem,
however, I've just opened the preferences dialog, made no changes and
clicked close. Five minutes or so later I'm still waiting for the gui to
become available again.

I'm running an up-to-date checkout from svn from a terminal and pressing
CTRL-C when the gui is &quot;frozen&quot; will generate a traceback and the gui will
become available again (nearly always including whatever changes had been
requested, i.e. podcasts that had been selected to be deleted are marked as
deleted, etc).

While it is entirely possible that there is something weird on my system
(FreeBSD 7-STABLE, up to date dependencies from the FreeBSD ports system), I
find it odd that the problem only seems to begin when the feed list contains
more than 30 feeds.

I've attached the contents of the traceback from the terminal that happens
when I press CTRL-C in case it helps. Nothing else on that is logged seems
unsual.

Alistair
