Maybe you should ask on the Tango (tango.freedesktop.org) mailing list
if someone can help with this icon?

Well, why not start now? Writing documentation is a good way to get more
competent :) As you have seen yourself, there are a few questions that a
newcomer has (the trash can, ...) that isn't obvious right away. Apart
from explaining these things to the end user, maybe you even find out
ways to avoid irritating icons and provide us with suggestions on how to
make the first-time experience better for end users :)

Thanks,
Thomas
