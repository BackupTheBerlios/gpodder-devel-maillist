That's pretty good.  But the arrow feels a bit like an icicle. I have 
the feeling that the download arrow should be somehow fainter or have 
dashed edges or something, to give the sense that this object *could* be 
downloaded.
Perhaps in that case one wouldn't need the cloud, which could distract
people (to me it seems natural, but one person is not a statistical 
sample). Perhaps the top of the arrow should just fade out at the top 
end.     Sorry I don't have a single clear idea....

&gt;<i> What about a text-based tooltip that is shown when the mouse moves over

Excellent idea. That would have helped me a lot.

</I>
Yes, as soon as I become competent!

I just got my first iPod and thanks to gpodder I have already listened
to several podcasts from the BBC and elsewhere, all done using Linux.
I am really very pleased with the whole thing.
