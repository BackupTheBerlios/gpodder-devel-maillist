</I>
Basically, it doesn't. But gdfs-check.py has &quot;import&quot; statements that
imports some parts of the gPodder Python modules. I am not really sure
how Python resolves the search order, but the basic problem is that you
have multiple different versions of the gPodder Python modules in,
say, /usr/ and /usr/local/ and if Python chooses the wrong one (as
happened to you), then it's like 0.11.1 gdfs-check.py is trying to work
with gPodder modules from 0.10.4 (or so).

&gt;<i> (b) Would it work if I got gdfs-check.py from the source for
</I>&gt;<i> version 0.10.4, which is the version of the package in /usr/?
</I>&gt;<i> (That's the version that the Fedora repository has provided).
</I>
Yes, grab the source tarball for the gPodder version you have installed
and use the gdfs scripts from there. You can download older source
tarballs for gPodder from this page:

<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5351">https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5351</A>

&gt;<i> (c) Wouldn't it make sense to provide gdfs-check.py and gdfs-init.py
</I>&gt;<i> in the package? Is Jeff Spaleta still the guy to talk to about that?
</I>
Basically, the gdfs-*.py scripts are unsupported, but they could be
included in a directory like /usr/share/doc/gpodder/examples/ (that's
where I would put them in the Debian package). I don't really have any
numbers on how many people are using the gdfs scripts, so I don't know
if the functionality is important to a majority of users or not.
