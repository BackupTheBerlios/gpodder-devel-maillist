<PRE>Hello!

In this post, I'm referring to the Gnome HIG, especially section
4.4.1.5., which can be found on this URL:

&#65279;<A HREF="http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/menus-standard.html.en">http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/menus-standard.html.en</A>

According to the Gnome HIG, we should probably only have a &quot;Quit&quot; button
(as you suggested), and have the &quot;Ctrl+Q&quot; button assigned to it.

We might want to add a &quot;Close&quot; menu item (&quot;Ctrl+W&quot;) as seen in this
screenshot:

<A HREF="http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/images/file-menu.png.en">http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/images/file-menu.png.en</A>

This &quot;Close&quot; menu item, the &quot;Quit&quot; menu item and the window's &quot;X&quot; button
should probably react this way:

              Tray icon enabled  |  Tray icon disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------
Close         Minimize to tray   |  Ask &quot;Quit?&quot;
Quit          Ask &quot;Quit?&quot;        |  Ask &quot;Quit?&quot;
&quot;X&quot;           Minimize to tray   |  Ask &quot;Quit?&quot;

The 'Ask &quot;Quit?&quot;' means:

 * If downloads are active, always ask
 * If downloads are not active:
     * If &quot;on_quit_ask&quot; is True, ask user
     * If &quot;on_quit_ask&quot; is False, quit without asking

I'm not yet sure about the &quot;X&quot; -&gt; &quot;Minimize to tray&quot; action. Maybe this
should be the Ask dialog with the option to hide to the systray, so
users get to decide if they want &quot;X&quot; to close gPodder (even with tray
icon enabled) or if they want &quot;X&quot; to minimize to tray.

This would make &quot;Close&quot; and &quot;Quit&quot; be consistent over the UI, but still
make it possible for the user to decide what to do on &quot;X&quot;.

What do you think? Would that sound reasonable and logical to you?

&gt;<i> As a side note, for me it tends to makes more sense to have Close 
</I>&gt;<i> hide/minimize to the tray and Quit immediately quit. Really though,
</I>&gt;<i> the current behavior is fine. (OTOH, I think some people aren't used
</I>&gt;<i> to the idea of Close minimizing to the tray. So this may actually be
</I>&gt;<i> more confusing to these users.)
</I>
&gt;<i>From a Mac OS X point of view (I really like the &quot;Option+W&quot; window
</I>closing and &quot;Option+Q&quot; application closing constistency, and Mac OS X is
what's got me into using these shortcuts on Linux [which were already
available without me knowing] and stopping using the awkward &quot;Alt+F4&quot; I
knew from some other OS), Quit and Close have their specific function.

These days, Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Q are nearly consistent across the whole
Linux desktop, except for VLC media player, which does the right thing
on Ctrl+Q, but opens a dialog on Ctrl+W (when I expect it to close the
VLC window). I think gPodder should have some sane behaviour here, and
I'm glad you people care (and tell us) about this kind of detailed
problems and annoyances that I initially didn't really see :)


Thanks,
Thomas
