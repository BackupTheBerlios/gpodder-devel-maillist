@Mark: Thanks for taking care of asking the Tango artists :)

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Mark!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After receiving your mail, I went to your site and took a look, as you 
</I>&gt;<i> requested. I realized that the main icon, the program icon, is not bad 
</I>&gt;<i> (the metaphor, the logo, I don't know how to call it) but I could try to

</I>
The metaphor should be the green man listening to podcasts on a portable
player. It would be _very_ cool if you could make one icon with a
portable player (iPod-like, as in the current icon) and one with a Nokia
N800/N810 instead of the portable player, because gPodder is also
available on Nokia Internet tablets, and it would be cool if we could
have a variant of the icon for the Nokia Internet Tablet version.

A N800: <A HREF="http://www.dslteam.de/news/bilder/04_n800_small.jpg">http://www.dslteam.de/news/bilder/04_n800_small.jpg</A> 

Hope I don't ask for too much :)

I didn't include earphones, but you might have a try on including them
on the green man's ears (see below for the old logo which had
earphones).

For the smaller versions of the icon, I think you know what's the
best thing to do (from what I see from other Tango Icons).

&gt;<i> Should I do this or will you never change your icon? (not to be 
</I>&gt;<i> understand in a negative and offensive way, that never changing)
</I>
Please do! :)

I've planned to ask Tango artists to review the current icon in
June 08, anyway, so I'll be very glad to have the icon reviewed
and improved by a Tango artist :) When I did the icon, I tried to
follow the guidelines, but I'm not an artist, so it can surely be
improved. Also, the 16x16 currently looks ugly, so this needs
special care :)

You can download the SVN and different icon sizes here:
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk/data/">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpodder/trunk/data/</A>

Additional resources:
* A very old version of the icon (which might help to think
  of the metaphor (&quot;green man listening to podcasts on a MP3 player&quot;)
  is in <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/gpodder/gpodder-0.8.0.tar.gz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/gpodder/gpodder-0.8.0.tar.gz</A>
  You find the file in &quot;data/gpodder.png&quot; in the tarball
* The initial try on getting a good Tango-ish icon for gPodder:
  <A HREF="http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/images/gpodder-icon-source.png">http://khan.thpinfo.com/~thp/images/gpodder-icon-source.png</A>
  and SVG: <A HREF="http://thpinfo.com/2007/archive/gpodder-icon-source.svg">http://thpinfo.com/2007/archive/gpodder-icon-source.svg</A> 

The license for the icons should be the same as gPodder's license,
which is &quot;GPLv3 or later&quot;. I hope this is okay for you.

Thanks very much for helping out with the icons :) Your help
is greatly appreciated!


Thomas
