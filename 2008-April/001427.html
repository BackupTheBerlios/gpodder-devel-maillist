<PRE>Hello!

I'm glad to announce the 0.11.2 release of gPodder, now available on the
website. This includes official support for the Maemo platform[1].

Thanks to all who sent patches, worked on features, sent a donation or
simply reported bugs. All your help is greatly appreciated and it's
really your work that really brings gPodder to a releaseable state every
month :)

Enjoy the weekend. Development will take on in early May when things at
University have settled down a bit. If you want to help out, please see
the Roadmap[2] for details on what we have planned for 0.11.3 and help
triaging bugs[3] and if you like, start working on one of the requested
features or simply leave some comments in the bug reports that might
help fix the issues reported.

Thanks,
Thomas

=============== release notes follow ==============

We're proud to release yet another gPodder version. This time, we call
it the &quot;Walk like a Panther&quot; release for no obvious reason, and we also
provide you with an official Maemo version of gPodder for all the
Internet Tablet fanboys out there.

Here's a list of the most important changes, for the full list of
changes, please see the ChangeLog file in the released tarball. We've
updated the list of contributors (patch writers, bug reporters and
donators) in the about dialog for this version. If you know you should
be on this list, but somehow aren't, please get in touch, and we'll add
you.

You can grab the release tarball now, get the Maemo version from the
Maemo repository (or use Application Manager if you already installed
gPodder from the repository on your Internet Tablet) or wait until your
distribution packages the new gPodder version for you :) Enjoy!

Thanks also to the people who sent donations during this release cycle -
your support is greatly appreciated! :)
