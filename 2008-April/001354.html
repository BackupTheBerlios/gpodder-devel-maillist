You should include this option on the gpodder website, since
it skips the hassle of having to set up an amazon.de account.

&gt;<i> From a usability point of view, do you think that the &quot;yellow star&quot; icon

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;file&quot; is not on their computer, but that the item is &quot;new&quot;?
</I>
Yes, it's obvious now you tell me, but I didn't understand that
icon at all. &quot;New&quot; is not quite right because it still implies that
the thing is (newly) present. You want something that implies 
&quot;available&quot;.
Perhaps a cloud with a download arrow coming out of it, implying that
this episode is still &quot;up there somewhere&quot;.

On the whole I prefer words to icons. That way of labelling things 
raises language issues, but it is much easier to look up the meaning of 
a word on the internet than to look up the meaning of an icon.

I looked on the gpodder home page for instructions on how to use gpodder 
(what the icons mean, how to do common tasks) but I couldn't find any. I 
guess people are supposed to add that to the wiki..?


&gt;&gt;<i> (c) syncing in the GUI did not work: the whole gpodder interface just

OK, well now by magic it is working! Perhaps before it wasn't frozen,
just quietly working away, and I was too impatient.
