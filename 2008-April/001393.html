<PRE>Hello!

The stabilization phase for 0.11.2 is starting this weekend, and I'll be
sending out a seperate mail for this one. There's still some things to
do to get ready for 0.11.2.

After having talked with Nick on #gpodder on FreeNode IRC, I thought
about the md5-summed download folder and file names (once again). I
think many users would be happy to get rid of these names and have
better user-readable names. I don't know how many feeds this will break,
or if it would work out good most of the time.

I'm really thinking about changing the default behaviour (or adding some
hidden option) to have human-readable file names for episodes. I think
somebody on this list already does this in the working copy, maybe you
can send me a patch?

What I thought about is letting the episode filenames be the basenames
of the files on the server. That would make it easy for us to get the
filename based on the URL (when no metadata is known) and also make it
better readable.

Of course, this could potentially break things a bit, but we're never
bug-free and (according to Nick, again) many other programs that
download podcasts don't break with this behaviour, so it would be
possible to try.

You can find a description of the problems in the gPodder FAQ
(<A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/faq">http://wiki.gpodder.org/faq</A>) in the question &quot;What about these odd
directory and file names that look like MD5 sums?&quot;. The plus side of
this change would be human-readable file names.


Now, it's your turn - motivate me or stop me from introducing this
change into the codebase ;) No, really - what do you think?

Thanks,
Thomas
