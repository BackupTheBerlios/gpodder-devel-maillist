<PRE>
Hello,

I've searched the list archives and couldn't find any reference to this. 
  I've been using gPodder for a couple of months now with no problems 
whatsoever.  My configuration was an IBM R40 laptop running Ubuntu 8.04, 
gPodder 0.11.2, 30GB iPod.

Recently, I upgraded my R40 to a T61.  It's a faster machine but I'm 
running the same software (Ubuntu 8.04, gPodder 0.11.2).  I rsync'ed my 
home directory to the new machine - so gPodder's configuration should be 
unchanged.

Now Ctrl+S does nothing.  I tried upgrading to gPodder 0.11.3 with no 
improvement.

I ran gPodder with the --verbose option with the following result.


Exception in thread Thread-3:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/threading.py&quot;, line 486, in __bootstrap_inner

   File &quot;usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gpodder/sync.py&quot;, line 208, in open
NameError: global name 'gpod' is not defined


Anyone have any idea what's wrong?
