&quot;ImportError: No module named gtk&quot; means you have not set up your
Python/PyGTK installation correctly. This is not a problem with gPodder,
but with your system/distro. You will notice that other pygtk-based
applications also do not work on your system.

Sorry for sounding like a distro nazi here, but we cannot support every
freakin' distro out there, and I sadly cannot give you any hints on how
to fix these problems on &quot;BLAG&quot;. Either ask the BLAG maintainers or fix
the problem yourself - as I said, the ImportError means that PyGTK is
not installed. This problem is out-of-scope for gPodder to support, as
it states in its README file that PyGTK needs to be installed.

I understand the value of choice and freedom, but as an upstream
maintainer, it's difficult to deal with people that report problems that
lie not with the software, but with the distribution. In that case,
having Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora users with a known distribution state is
much easier for upstream projects to support.

I'm sorry that I can't really help you here (because I don't know BLAG)
and hope that you will be able to fix that problems. Please contact the
BLAG mailing list which (I presume from googling around) can be found at
<A HREF="https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/blag-users">https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/blag-users</A>

If there are still problems with gPodder _after_ you got PyGTK working
on your system, please, by all means report the problem or send a mail
to the gpodder-devel mailing list - that's what it's are here for :)


Good luck!
Thomas
