Of course not, I'm very glad for any help, as I'm currently very busy
doing other things and don't have so much time for gPodder.

The bug to post patches and discuss things is here:

   <A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57">http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57</A>

&gt;<i> I haven't looked but is the code you used to test the file naming in

</I>
I have looked, but don't think so. Basically, what the code does is uses
gPodder's &quot;opml&quot; module to load the OPML file and channels, then for
each channel do the following:

1) create an empty dict
2) for each episode:
   *) call the (modified) local_filename() method, save the return value
   *) if the return value is not in the dict, add it and continue
   *) if the return value is in the dict, there has been a collision

Shouldn't be too hard to implement this with the gPodder library
functions.

You might want to &quot;assign&quot; bug #57 to you, so we know you are working on
it.


Thanks,
Thomas
