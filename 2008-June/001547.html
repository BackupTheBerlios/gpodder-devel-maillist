With the SQLite changes, we'll have proper support for &quot;do not mark as
new&quot; and also keeping track of the deleted status. I agree that the
current way of &quot;deleting&quot; an episode to not show it as downloaded is a
bit strange and unintuitive.

If all works out well, the new version (0.11.4) will have this fixed.
