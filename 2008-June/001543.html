<PRE>Hello there!

If you haven't watched Bugzilla or the IRC channel recently, you might
wonder when we are going to start the stabilization phase for our June
release, gPodder 0.11.4[1].

In fact, we've been very busy, and Justin Forest is currently working on
the SQLite patch[2], which will bring faster code and pave the way for
many fixes and features that we couldn't implement for technical reasons
before.

You can help by trying to &quot;migrate&quot; your current gPodder database
(backups are always good to do before) to SQLite and see how things work
out for you. Just use the latest SVN trunk[3] and apply the latest patch
found on the bug page[2] and report any problems or praise the good work
done so far - depending on your success (or lack thereof).

Anyway, if you need help or just want to hang around with the other
gPodder people, the gPodder IRC channel on FreeNode (#gpodder on
irc.freenode.net) has been used more than usual for the last few days.
You can also answer questions by newbies landing in #gpodder :)

I expect the SQLite patch to be ready for inclusion in SVN trunk until
the end of this week - this is also the time when we'll start the 0.11.4
stabilization branch. Because there are quite some changes, it's very
important that people help testing the patch and report any problems
found _before_ we are going to release 0.11.4, so... Try it out! ;)


Thanks,
Thomas
