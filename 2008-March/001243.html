<PRE>Hello!

As promised some months ago, here's the survey about your use cases for
gPodder. Please take the time to write a short description on how you
use gPodder and with what devices you use it, especially:

 * How often do you check for new episodes? Manual or automatically?
 * To how many channels are you currently subscribed to?
 * Do you leave your episodes in gPodder or export them using &quot;save as&quot;?
 * Do you use the iPod/MP3 player or Bluetooth sync feature? With what?
 * Have you written custom scripts/utilities to fix gPodder annoyances?
 * Have you had problems with some feeds? (missing pubdate, length,...)
 * Are you using other podcast-related services that could be integrated
   into gPodder but currently aren't?
 * Have you been using gPodders ogg-to-mp3 conversion feature for iPods?
 * Are you running the SVN version of gPodder or which released version?

Maybe this can bring in some fresh ideas or get some inspiration from
other people's &quot;gPodder workflows&quot;. Or maybe not. It depends on you ;)


Thomas
