Thanks, I've applied your patch as-is to SVN trunk :)

Yes, I also think that the clean-up has to be taken care by the last.fm
client, that's what the spec also says. I just wondered if rockbox had
any kind of intelligence built-in that would make sure the file didn't
grow endlessly if the file is never deleted by a last.fm client (as is
the case when one enables this feature for the sole purpose of getting
played state synchronization to work with gPodder, without ever using
last.fm).
