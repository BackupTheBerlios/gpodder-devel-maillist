I thought about this some time ago, because I had a hard time spotting
the correct popup menu item, because the title indeed adds a lot of
noise. When I initially did this, I thought it was a good idea, but I
see your point now. I would like to keep the multiple selection actions
(i.e. &quot;transfer 2 selected episodes to iPod&quot;) but I think I can make it
so that we get the following translatable strings:

 &quot;Transfer this episode to %s&quot; (i.e. iPod)
 &quot;Transfer %d episodes to %s&quot; (i.e. 4, iPod)
 &quot;Play this episode&quot; (or simply: &quot;Play&quot;?)
 &quot;Play %d selected episodes&quot; (i.e. 2)
 &quot;Mark this episode as played&quot;
 &quot;Mark %d selected episodes as played&quot; (i.e. 5)

Would this work? What do you think?

Thanks,
Thomas
