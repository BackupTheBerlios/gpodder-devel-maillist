</I>&gt;<i> Well, one thing I've run into, though I think it's more my own stupidity: I
</I>&gt;<i> added a bunch of podcasts with gpodder, but withouth thinking I then added a
</I>&gt;<i> file using gtkpod, which was already open. gtkpod updated with what it knew

</I>&gt;<i> entries. the free space on the ipod is pretty clearly taking into account the
</I>&gt;<i> podcasts, though, so I'm not sure how to update the ipod to either delete the
</I>&gt;<i> extraneous files or add them to the menu :-\
</I>
Seems to be fine. Did a 'check files' in gtkpod, deleted all orphaned, then in
gpodder transferred podcasts.

I'll just have to remember not to run gtkpod and gpodder at the same time, just
so I don't pull something stupid again. Otherwise, this is working very well so
far.

chocolate factory, and to be romantically linked to a  celebrity.
 Bender: I could pound your head 'til you think that's what happened.
 Fry: Okay.
