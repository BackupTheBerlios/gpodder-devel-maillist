&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As promised some months ago, here's the survey about your use cases for
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder. Please take the time to write a short description on how you
</I>&gt;<i> use gPodder and with what devices you use it, especially:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * How often do you check for new episodes? Manual or automatically?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Automatically - set to 90 minutes, but I don't always keep it running.
&gt;<i>  * To how many channels are you currently subscribed to?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>20 audio

&gt;<i>  * Do you leave your episodes in gPodder or export them using &quot;save as&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Export using mp3 sync with &quot;delete after sync&quot; - I always listen to them
only on my mp3 player.
&gt;<i>  * Do you use the iPod/MP3 player or Bluetooth sync feature? With what?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, with my Nokia phone (OggPlay) - I remove the SD card and sync to that.

&gt;<i>  * Have you written custom scripts/utilities to fix gPodder annoyances?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I have a gpodder-add.sh script that I use to add feeds from firefox
(just runs 'gpodder -a &quot;$@&quot;')

I also have a script that I run to create m3u files that I run after I
sync to my mp3 player.

Lastly, because my mp3 player does strange things with mp3 files that
are too long, sometimes I have to use mp3splt on really long episodes.

&gt;<i>  * Have you had problems with some feeds? (missing pubdate, length,...)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, or at least not recently.
&gt;<i>  * Are you using other podcast-related services that could be integrated
</I>&gt;<i>    into gPodder but currently aren't?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No
&gt;<i>  * Have you been using gPodders ogg-to-mp3 conversion feature for iPods?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>My player supports ogg.
&gt;<i>  * Are you running the SVN version of gPodder or which released version?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>SVN
&gt;<i> Maybe this can bring in some fresh ideas or get some inspiration from
</I>&gt;<i> other people's &quot;gPodder workflows&quot;. Or maybe not. It depends on you ;)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Notes:
-Sometimes I start a second instance when I forget that I have gPodder
minimized to the tray - it would be nice to either not allow this, or
pop-up the existing window.
-Some podcasts I listen to are online classes, for these it would be
nice if gPodder could download the oldest episodes first.
-I have had to delete feedcache.db a few times due to corruption.
