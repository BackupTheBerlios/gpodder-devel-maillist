<PRE>Howdy all, should be interesting to see how varied usage is.

&gt;<i>   * How often do you check for new episodes? Manual or automatically?
</I>
I check about twice every day, manually. I download episodes I want,
then mark unwanted episodes as &quot;deleted&quot; so they won't pop up during
the next update.

&gt;<i>   * To how many channels are you currently subscribed to?
</I>
23, all audio.

&gt;<i>   * Do you leave your episodes in gPodder or export them using &quot;save as&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>   * Do you use the iPod/MP3 player or Bluetooth sync feature? With what?
</I>
I leave them in gPodder, deleting them upon sync w/iPod Nano (1g).

&gt;<i>   * Have you written custom scripts/utilities to fix gPodder annoyances?
</I>
No

&gt;<i>   * Have you had problems with some feeds? (missing pubdate, length,...)
</I>
No consistently reproducible issues.

&gt;<i>   * Are you using other podcast-related services that could be integrated
</I>&gt;<i>    into gPodder but currently aren't?
</I>
No

&gt;<i>   * Have you been using gPodders ogg-to-mp3 conversion feature for iPods?
</I>
No, all of my podcasts come in mp3 flavor. (Never even run across an
ogg formatted feed.)

&gt;<i>   * Are you running the SVN version of gPodder or which released version?
</I>
I run the SVN version.

Thanks,
- FB
