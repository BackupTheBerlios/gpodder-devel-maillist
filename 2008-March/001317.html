Great work! I've looked through your patch and cleaned up some things
(moved the find_mount_point function to gpodder.util, rename the config
option, so people know this is related to mp3 players, re-structure some
other parts of the code, move the list of possible file names to the
class instead of having it per-instance, etc..). I have attached the
updated patch, please have a look at it and try it out if it doesn't
break anything.

I'll merge the patch to SVN trunk if everything works and you are happy
with the patch. I think this could really be an useful feature. One
question remains, however: Which program is supposed to &quot;clean&quot; that
file, or is Rockbox keeping it down to a maximum size, so it doesn't
grow endlessly?

Thanks,
Thomas
