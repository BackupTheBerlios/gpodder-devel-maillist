Hey Thomas!

Two words to sum up the speed improvements: -holy crap-

Coincidentally I was doing a bunch of testing this morning to see what was 
causing gPodder's slow start up. In my testing I found it took about 46 
seconds for svn r612 to start up and when using the psyco &quot;specializing 
compiler&quot; I was able to get it down to about 30 sec. Applying your patch 
(non-splash) brought that down to 5.7 seconds!

The splash screen is very nice (with compiz turned on) but like Bernd said, it 
would be very nice to know what's going on while it's loading. Perhaps just 
some text saying &quot;x feeds of y loaded&quot; or something like that just to inform 
the user that something is indeed happening.

Great work,

nick
