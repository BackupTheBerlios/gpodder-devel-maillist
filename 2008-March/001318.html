Hello Thomas,

Thank you for looking over and improving my code :)  

I added one small thing, if find_mount_point() returns '/' then to prevent 
find_scrobbler_log() from os.walk()'ing your whole root filesystem we simply 
set mp3_player_mount_point to the the directory that we're syncing to. Appart 
from that I think the patch is ready.

Ideally the .scrobbler.log file should be cleaned by scrobbler software that 
submits tracks to last.fm. I wrote a small python module that can scrobble 
tracks but I don't really think that it belongs in gPodder. (Unless you 
really think otherwise...)

Have a good day,

nick
