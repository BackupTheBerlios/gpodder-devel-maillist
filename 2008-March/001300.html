Just be sure to check your iPod's data files every now and then because
there hsa been a report that this feature isn't working as expected. I
haven't had the time to look at it, and I have yet to see this bug on my
iPod mini, but please don't say you have been warned ;)

Bug URL: <A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68">http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68</A>

If we can't find a solution to this bug this week, I think I'm going to
disable the extended gtkpod database support from the 0.11.1 release
(keeping it in SVN trunk, however), because I don't want to get a
zillion bug reports about corrupted iTunesDBs ;)

Of couse, if you feel brave, feel free to test this code. It would be
very helpful if we could get some results from you, too.

Thanks,
Thomas
