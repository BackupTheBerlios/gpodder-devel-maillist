<PRE>OK, here are my answers.

&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As promised some months ago, here's the survey about your use cases for
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder. Please take the time to write a short description on how you
</I>&gt;<i> use gPodder and with what devices you use it, especially:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * How often do you check for new episodes? Manual or automatically?
</I>
Automatically every 30 minutes.

&gt;<i>  * To how many channels are you currently subscribed to?
</I>
16 channels.

&gt;<i>  * Do you leave your episodes in gPodder or export them using &quot;save as&quot;?
</I>
I leave them in gpodder.

&gt;<i>  * Do you use the iPod/MP3 player or Bluetooth sync feature? With what?
</I>
Sometimes I use the sync feature with my iaudio M5 (filesystem based mp3
player), but I don't do it too often.

&gt;<i>  * Have you written custom scripts/utilities to fix gPodder annoyances?
</I>
No, not yet. Once I learn some python I might. I was thinking of making
something to let it convert videos to dpg or dsv format, for playing on
the nintendo DS and then transfering them.

&gt;<i>  * Have you had problems with some feeds? (missing pubdate, length,...)
</I>
Just one, which had a password. I sorted it out in the end.

&gt;<i>  * Are you using other podcast-related services that could be integrated
</I>&gt;<i>    into gPodder but currently aren't?
</I>
None that I can think of.

&gt;<i>  * Have you been using gPodders ogg-to-mp3 conversion feature for iPods?
</I>
No, my mp3 player plays ogg vorbis.

&gt;<i>  * Are you running the SVN version of gPodder or which released version?
</I>
svn version.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this can bring in some fresh ideas or get some inspiration from
</I>&gt;<i> other people's &quot;gPodder workflows&quot;. Or maybe not. It depends on you ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
