Yes, I think the most time-consuming part was that DumbShelve was
serializing the whole feed data every time sync() was called on it. I
fixed this by marking it as dirty when there have been updates and only
serializing and writing to file when it is &quot;dirty&quot;. I'm currently
working on polishing the patch a bit more, so it's ready to go into SVN.

&gt;<i> The splash screen is very nice (with compiz turned on) but like Bernd
</I>&gt;<i> said, it would be very nice to know what's going on while it's
</I>&gt;<i> loading. Perhaps just some text saying &quot;x feeds of y loaded&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that just to inform the user that something is indeed
</I>&gt;<i> happening.
</I>
I will put it into &quot;doc/dev/&quot; in SVN's trunk, so we have it in case we
want to use it in the future (when all desktops are composited by
default?), because it doesn't look so good with non-composited desktops.
Also, with the patch you sent (the entity regex patch), I get my gPodder
starting up in 1.50 seconds (with 9 feeds), so the splash screen would
probably only slow down things here ;)

Thanks for your feedback :)

Thomas
