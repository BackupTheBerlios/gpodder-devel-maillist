<PRE>Hello!

A new gPodder release is out. Get it from gpodder.org or continue using
the SVN version :) As always, packages in distributions should be
available soon. Thanks to all who were involved in this release =)

Release notes from the gPodder website follow.

Thanks,
Thomas

============

This month, we have seen our 600th commit in the SVN repository, which
means our version history is growing every month and we can consider
ourselves quite a mature project now. Of course, this doesn't mean that
development is slowing down. On the contrary: We're here to announce the
immediate availability of gPodder 0.11.1, the release that has been
attacked by Killer Tomatoes! We got rid of a huge number of bugs and
fulfilled nearly all of our release goals.

About the not-fulfilled release goals: We can't reproduce the &quot;Moving
download directory doesn't work bug (#8), so if you experience this bug,
please leave a comment in our Bug tracker. Some other feature goals have
been moved out of the way, because after we conducted our &quot;What's your
gPodder workflow?&quot; survey, we found that gPodder's users would rather
have a rock-solid, stable gPodder than tons of features that are not
really needed. Of course, we will continue adding useful features and
extend existing ones, but we try to focus on stable releases.

That's it for this month - please download the new release or try the
SVN version of you feel brave. Packages in distributions will appear in
the upcoming days or weeks, as usual.
