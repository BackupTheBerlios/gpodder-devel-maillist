<PRE>Hello!
&gt;<i>  * How often do you check for new episodes? Manual or automatically?
</I>Every day after the login, I start gpodder and check manually.

&gt;<i>  * To how many channels are you currently subscribed to?
</I>~10

&gt;<i>  * Do you leave your episodes in gPodder or export them using &quot;save
</I>&gt;<i> as&quot;?
</I>Leave in gPodder

&gt;<i> * Do you use the iPod/MP3 player or Bluetooth sync feature? With 
</I>&gt;<i> what?
</I>filesystembased MP3-player

&gt;<i> * Have you written custom scripts/utilities to fix gPodder 
</I>&gt;<i> annoyances?
</I>Once I used mp3splt inside gpodder to split large files, but I managed 
to get around the problem on my MP3-player.

&gt;<i> * Have you had problems with some feeds? (missing 
</I>&gt;<i> pubdate, length,...)
</I>No.

&gt;<i> * Are you using other podcast-related services 
</I>&gt;<i> that could be integrated into gPodder but currently aren't?
</I>Sometimes I look on the website of the podcast or the channel, because 
there are some intresting links related to the podcast or there is a 
blog with comments on the podcast. It would be useful to open the site 
from the contextmenu.

&gt;<i>  * Have you been using gPodders ogg-to-mp3 conversion feature for
</I>&gt;<i> iPods?
</I>No, don't need it.

&gt;<i> * Are you running the SVN version of gPodder or which released 
</I>&gt;<i> version?
</I>0.11.0

Generally, gPodder sometimes is a bit slow. More things like syncing 
with the mp3-player or updating the feeds should run in the background, 
so I can continue browsing through the feeds and marking podcasts for 
downloading and transfering to the mp3-player.
