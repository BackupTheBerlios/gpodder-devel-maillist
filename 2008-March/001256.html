<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE> &gt;  * How often do you check for new episodes? Manual or automatically?
once/week manually
 &gt;  * To how many channels are you currently subscribed to?
~47
 &gt;  * Do you leave your episodes in gPodder or export them using &quot;save as&quot;?
leave in gPodder
 &gt;  * Do you use the iPod/MP3 player or Bluetooth sync feature? With what?
USB-stick like MP3 player
 &gt;  * Have you written custom scripts/utilities to fix gPodder annoyances?
no
 &gt;  * Have you had problems with some feeds? (missing pubdate, length,...)
yes, but don't remember.
 &gt;  * Are you using other podcast-related services that could be integrated
 &gt;    into gPodder but currently aren't?
no
 &gt;  * Have you been using gPodders ogg-to-mp3 conversion feature for iPods?
no
 &gt;  * Are you running the SVN version of gPodder or which released version?
0.11.0 from tarball at homepage. runs on Ubuntu Gutsy installed with 
checkinstall.
 &gt; Maybe this can bring in some fresh ideas or get some inspiration from
 &gt; other people's &quot;gPodder workflows&quot;. Or maybe not. It depends on you ;)
* please let us define priority podcasts that should always be synced to 
MP3 and others that can only be downloaded.
E.g. If I would add some public radios my 2GB MP3 gets easily filled up. 
Neverthelless, I'd like to keep track of these stations...

Thanks for your efforts!
