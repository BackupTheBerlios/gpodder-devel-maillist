Okay, I have not been warned ;)

Ouch. That would hurt.

</I>&gt;<i> (keeping it in SVN trunk, however), because I don't want to get a

</I>&gt;<i> Of couse, if you feel brave, feel free to test this code. It would be

Once I got gpodder working last night, I went pretty well nuts adding podcasts
to my device (ipod classic 80GB), too many in fact, just to see what was out
there. Just did a sync now, before I read your post, and am relieved to see
that there appears to be no issues.

One thing I did notice, when gpodder goes to write the extended database, it
seems to take a long time, about a minute I'd say. Seems rather long for a
process that is only writing to a text file, but then I really have no idea at
all what's involved, so there you go :-)

Thanks for the heads up!

 but look in your heart and ask yourself: are you funky
 enough to be a Globe Trotter? Are you?
 Bender: Yes.
 Bubblegum: Are you? 
 Bender: I mean, with time, my funk level could... 
 Bubblegum: Are you?!
 Bender: No. 
 Bubblegum: Deal with it.
