<PRE>Hello Alain,

Thanks, applied against svn trunk.

I've tracked down the problem and error handling for not-well-formed
RSS feeds (or not-at-all-RSS-feed URLs) should be improved now. The
ill-formed channels are skipped when being added, and the question if
the user wants to download the recent episodes is only shown when a new
channel has been added. As a side effect, I've re-factored some things
in rssReader and opmlReader (basically removed static members), so
the code for these classes is more sane now ;)

&gt;<i> - I had an old channel which as no more episodes associated
</I>&gt;<i>   with it, and cannot remove it. It may just be related to my 
</I>&gt;<i>   channel cache, but this may be real bug too ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't time to play around with the &quot;same name&quot; stuff nor with 
</I>&gt;<i> the synchronization folder, but I'll try to do it this week end.
</I>
Don't know about these two bugs - maybe you can explain the problem in
a bit more detail (if you're not going to try to patch it yourself), so
I can have a look as time permits?


Thanks,
Thomas
