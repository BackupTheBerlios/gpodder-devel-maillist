<PRE>Hello Jeff,

Thanks, I've updated the downloads page accordingly and placed a link
to <A HREF="http://fedoraproject.org/extras/6/i386/repodata/repoview/gpodder-0-0.8.0-3.fc6.html">http://fedoraproject.org/extras/6/i386/repodata/repoview/gpodder-0-0.8.0-3.fc6.html</A>

Hope that's the best URL to refer to the package info/metadata. If not,
just tell me and I can change the link.

I'm indeed thinking of a &quot;0.8.9&quot; release (that is basically what 0.9.0
is going to be), so we can fix some bugs. I'll send a mail to the
mailing list as soon as there is info about that release, and you can
put it into fedora-development so we can have a broader testing
audience.

Last time, gPodder 0.8.0 was released one week after 0.7.9, so expect a
timeframe like this for 0.8.9/0.9.0 too. I hope to get some free time
to do release preparation (and release) work soon.


Enjoy.
Thomas
