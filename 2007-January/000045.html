<PRE>Hello Holger,

Sure, I've added it to the TODO list. Would a color chooser in the
preferences dialog suit your needs? I don't think we can automatically
calculate &quot;good&quot; colors from the gtk theme colors.

Also added to the TODO list. Things like the tray icon are probably
easy to implement but due to lack of time, I currently can't do it. If
anyone wants to have a look at it, please by all means do. You probably
need the PyGTK documentation and some minor initialization code in
gpodder.py. I imagine the status text simply being a tooltip that is
updated from the download status manager (or simply the window title).
Don't know if PyGTK already supports the new &quot;notification balloons&quot;
seen with current gnome-power-manager et al. Hmm.. weekend maybe ;)


Enjoy.
Thomas
