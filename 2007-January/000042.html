<PRE>Hello gpodder devs. Hello list.

First let me thank you for gpodder. It's a nice and (c)lean podcast
client. I love it and I use it daily. 
However, I have two suggestion.
First, please don't use hard coded background colors when you use the
foreground color from the current gtk theme at the same time. Right now
you assume people always have a theme with dark text color, which is
just not true. My theme uses a bright text color and that makes the
podcasts list unreadable, which uses yellow/white as background. Also
think about people using gnomes highcontrast inverse theme (white text
color).
My second suggestion is to include a systray icon similar to the ones
many music players have. It would be great if I could hide/show the
gpodder window by clicking on it. Getting current download status on
mouseover would be amazing. Being notified when a download finished
either by status icon or notification popup would be the ne plus
ultra. :)
Oh I'm using the svn version from today and I'm looking forward for the
0.9 release.

Thanks for reading.
Holger
