iPod sync support mostly depends on libgpod here. As gtkpod uses
libgpod too, maybe some special flags have to set in the iTunesDB on
iPod nanos. Maybe you want to investigate on the libgpod mailing list
and check back here if you get any information on what's the difference
between iPod nano iTunesDB properties for Podcasts and the other iPods.
I personally don't have an iPod nano, so I can't check and test if it
works. If you would volunteer, this would surely be great :)


Thanks,
Thomas
