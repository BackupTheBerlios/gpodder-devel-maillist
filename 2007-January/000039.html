<PRE>I think these are basically wishlist-type things, but maybe it's something I'm missing, or something that's planned.

First off, the sync command seems to be a one-way transfer.  It doesn't seem to delete from the iPod the episodes that have been deleted in gpodder.  Sure, I can use the &quot;clean up&quot; command, which seems to delete all of them, and then sync, but that's a lot of extra disk activity.

Also, is there an automated way to keep only the most recent X episodes?

Also, the problems with multiple NPR downloads seems to have vanished.  I don't know if that was a fix to the SVN gpodder, or a byproduct of switching from Slackware to Ubuntu.

Thanks,
Andy
