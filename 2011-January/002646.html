<PRE>Hi,

On Thu, Jan 6, 2011 at 3:40 AM, Leif Andersen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpodder-devel">leif at leifandersen.net</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> So one of the features that NetCatch needs to have is integration to
</I>&gt;<i> gpodder.net. &#160;It seems like there is a published API here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/Web_Services/API_2,">http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/Web_Services/API_2,</A> and even a java version
</I>&gt;<i> of software to connect with here: <A HREF="https://github.com/nheid/mygpodderlib">https://github.com/nheid/mygpodderlib</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;However, it does not state what license it is under. &#160;Is it safe to
</I>&gt;<i> assume that it is GPL? &#160;If so, does it matter what version? &#160;(The FSF
</I>&gt;<i> seems to claim that v2 is not compatible with Apache, but v3 is, and
</I>&gt;<i> although I don't agree with some of the FSFs claims about dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> linking, I would like to avoid any legal troubles I may have in the future).
</I>
As Bernd already pointed out, mygpodderlib has been developed for
GpodRoid, which is licensed under the Eclipse Public License v1.0 [1].
However I don't know if it is safe to assume that mygpodderlib uses
the same license. Maybe open a new issue and ask for license info to
be added.


&gt;<i> Finally, if you have any other feedback to send me (even if it's just to
</I>&gt;<i> tell me that I shouldn't call it DroidPodder or something like that), I
</I>&gt;<i> would appreciate hearing about it, as well as any other help you're
</I>&gt;<i> willing to give with the project. &#160;Remember though that it still is an
</I>&gt;<i> early alpha, and a lot of the features are missing, and the ones that
</I>&gt;<i> are there are quite buggy.
</I>
It's always great to hear about new gPodder / gpodder.net related
projects! As I am the maintainer of gpodder.net, feel free to contact
me with any issues regarding it.
