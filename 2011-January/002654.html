<PRE>Hi Leif and all,

</I>
Judging from my experience with gPodder on Maemo devices (which was one
of the initial motivations for creating the feedservice), offloading the
parsing and downloading of feeds to a web service is a good idea for
several reasons:

 * The server-side could implement intelligent caching and only supply
   differences (not implemented, but a possibility)
 * Buggy/ugly feeds can be fixed on the server side
 * The server filters the feeds and returns wonderful, pre-parsed JSON
   that can be taken by the client as a single entity
 * One single request to the server can download all podcasts, whereas
   with client-side parsing you have to contact every web server

I'll be using the feedservice for a future project, and maybe I'll also
add support for it to gPodder - at least for mobile versions. Of course,
using the feedservice has the disadvantage of relying on the service to
be available, but that's about the only disadvantage of it ;)

HTH.
Thomas
