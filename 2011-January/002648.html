<PRE>Wow, thank you all so much for your support, I didn't realise that there
was so many other projects trying to do similar things.  I'll spend
today looking at your code and seeing what parts are useful, and if we
can consolidate are work.

&gt;<i> I really would like to see an Android gPodder application which syncs
</I>&gt;<i> with mygpodder.net. But in the moment there are only two projects and
</I>&gt;<i> none of them are ready at the moment? 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you ever contacted Nico Heid and talked with him about his
</I>&gt;<i> projects and his plans?
</I>
No, I haven't contacted him yet.  I didn't know he was working on an
android app (I thought the project was aiming to be just a generic java
library), so it simply didn't occur to me to do so.  Also, if you are
alluding to the version I've been working on, I would say that it's not
ready yet, as I currently don't use it as my main android podcatcher, as
there are too many bugs.  (Although if the bugs were to magically
disappear, there currently is enough features in there for me to use it
as my primary podcatcher).

&gt;<i> As Bernd already pointed out, mygpodderlib has been developed for
</I>&gt;<i> GpodRoid, which is licensed under the Eclipse Public License v1.0 [1].
</I>&gt;<i> However I don't know if it is safe to assume that mygpodderlib uses
</I>&gt;<i> the same license. Maybe open a new issue and ask for license info to
</I>&gt;<i> be added.
</I>
Really, I find that fascinating,  The EPL was my first license of
choice, but I ultimately decided against it as it seemed that very few
project used it (relatively so). and it wasn't compatible with many
other licences.

&gt;<i> It's always great to hear about new gPodder / gpodder.net related
</I>&gt;<i> projects! As I am the maintainer of gpodder.net, feel free to contact
</I>&gt;<i> me with any issues regarding it.
</I>
Okay, thank you.

&gt;<i> Of course it might be feasible to combine your efforts into one common
</I>&gt;<i> project, but I also don't see a problem with having two competing
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a related note, which might be interesting to both projects: I've
</I>&gt;<i> been working on mygpo-feedservice [1] which is a webservice for
</I>&gt;<i> parsing podcast feeds and delivering the contents as JSON. This could
</I>&gt;<i> offload a bit of the parsing-work from the clients to the service and
</I>&gt;<i> hence speed up the applications. Feel free to contact me if you are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in using it.
</I>
True, but if we need code that does similar things, I would be happy to
work with the other person to get both of them out faster.  Also, I'll
take a look at your parser, it seems interesting.  I'm not sure how long
it takes to parse XML on a device like that (I'm using the built in
Document object, combined with NodeList and Element, I based the idea
off of a friends piece of code (which was also released under the Apache
v2 licence)), but so far it seems like downloading the feed is the
bottleneck.  Either way, it does look interesting, and I'll preform some
tests to compare speed.

Anyway, thank you everyone for your feedback, I look forward to
continuing to work with you in the future.
