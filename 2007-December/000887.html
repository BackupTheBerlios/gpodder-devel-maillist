<PRE>I saw the post in the archive about cron for gpodder --run. What about a
command for syncing to your device?

Eventually I'd like to be running gpodder via cron and somehow creating
daily play lists of what gets downloaded each day. Any ideas on how that
would be possible? My device is an Archos 605 which is mounted at
/media/A605 and has a folder /media/A605/Podcasts and /media/A605/Playlists.
So far the gui sync works great and I've been able to manually create a play
list, put it in the Playlists folder and get it to play files in the
Podcasts folder, so the basic concept is there, now just to automate. WIth
the release date in gpodder as well as the command line dump of files
downloaded it would be great to harvest those or sort them in to a today's
podcast m3u and sync it too.

Some suggestions for future development:
Cleanup based on rating and/or having been listened to. If the rating is
still 0 and has been played, delete.
Ability to change or insert id3 data for each feed on each track downloaded.
Some feeds don't include data or are inconsistent.
Playlists by date, feed, category... synced to devices
