<PRE>Hello, Clark!

&gt;<i> I saw the post in the archive about cron for gpodder --run. What about a command

</I>
No, that's not possible at the moment. I've just added a new FAQ entry
for your question at <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/faq">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/faq</A>

I'm currently working on the new code, so it should not be too long
until the new sync code will work.

&gt;<i> Eventually I'd like to be running gpodder via cron and somehow creating daily 
</I>&gt;<i> play lists of what gets downloaded each day. Any ideas on how that would be 
</I>&gt;<i> possible? My device is an Archos 605 which is mounted at /media/A605 and has a 
</I>&gt;<i> folder /media/A605/Podcasts and /media/A605/Playlists. So far the gui sync works 
</I>&gt;<i> great and I've been able to manually create a play list, put it in the Playlists 
</I>&gt;<i> folder and get it to play files in the Podcasts folder, so the basic concept is 
</I>&gt;<i> there, now just to automate. WIth the release date in gpodder as well as the 
</I>&gt;<i> command line dump of files downloaded it would be great to harvest those or sort 
</I>&gt;<i> them in to a today's  podcast m3u and sync it too.
</I>
Can you send me an example .m3u from your Archos 605, so I can have a
look how relative or absolute paths are added and which metadata is
added how to this file? I have only a very basic understanding of .m3u
files back in the day when I was playing around with Winamp when it was
still freeware and not as bloated as now :)

&gt;<i> Cleanup based on rating and/or having been listened to. If the rating is still 0 
</I>&gt;<i> and has been played, delete.
</I>
Where is the rating saved on the Archos/how to read this information? I
think we could do something like that with iPod sync (again I have to
refer to Paul Rudkin's great idea of &quot;locking&quot; episodes: if the rating
is above a certain value, the episode is locked inside gPodder and will
also not be deleted on the iPod).

&gt;<i> Ability to change or insert id3 data for each feed on each track downloaded. 
</I>&gt;<i> Some feeds don't include data or are inconsistent.
</I>
If you install eyeD3 and enable &quot;Update tags on audio files after
download&quot; in the &quot;Extras&quot; tab of the preferences window, the ID3 data
will be added from the feed metadata.

&gt;<i> Playlists by date, feed, category... synced to devices
</I>
Is this &quot;sorted by date, feed, category?&quot;. Which category do you mean?
The one present in the RSS feed? Can you give some example feeds and
what their category would be?

Thanks for your suggestions and your feedback!
Thomas
