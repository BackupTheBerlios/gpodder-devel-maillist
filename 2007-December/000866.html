<PRE>Hello, Pieter!

I think we should move this into a preference. Something like &quot;Episodes
are considered old after [___] days&quot;. That's because I want to add the
episode clean-up feature for the iPod as well, and so all &quot;clean-up&quot;
code could use the same settings.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sorting by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pubDate would also be possible, but there are (again, broken) feeds that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do not have any pubDate value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's a bummer. You could solve this by implementing a cleaner that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't delete undated episodes and keeping the current episode
</I>&gt;<i> deletion feature in gPodder. Or you could develop an auto-cleaner (can
</I>&gt;<i> be configured in the Settings window) and leave the episode deletion
</I>&gt;<i> feature as it is. Would that provide a good workaround to the broken
</I>&gt;<i> feed problem?
</I>
What speaks against the current implementation with a new button &quot;remove
old episodes&quot; with the time range for &quot;old&quot; defined in the preferences
dialog? We can always implement it so that episodes without timestamp
are just ignored (i.e. they have to be checked manually).

What do you think?

Thomas
