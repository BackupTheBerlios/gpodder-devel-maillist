<PRE>Hi Thomas,

&gt;<i> If you mount the iPod via ssh, does this mean
</I>&gt;<i> that you can wirelessly copy podcasts to your iPod
</I>&gt;<i> or is it still connected via USB?
</I>Nope, it's all wireless. My computer connects to my iPod through its IP
address on my wireless network.

&gt;<i> The link you sent from cbcradio3 only contains MP3 files, maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced podcast feed is something different?
</I>iTunes recognized it as enhanced, how strange... Here's the correct URL:
<A HREF="http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/enhanced/">http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/enhanced/</A>

I don't think that you quite understand what an enhanced podcast is. I'll
try to explain it using screenshots in a bit. First, here's how podcasts
work on the iPod touch:
<A HREF="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/9706/1000799tc8.jpg">http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/9706/1000799tc8.jpg</A> (podcast menu)
<A HREF="http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/3479/1000798bg0.jpg">http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/3479/1000798bg0.jpg</A> (podcast submenu)

When I listen to a regular podcast, this is what happens when I bring up the
playlist:
<A HREF="http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/6164/1000795ra4.jpg">http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/6164/1000795ra4.jpg</A>

With enhanced podcasts however, this happens:
<A HREF="http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/9130/1000793gw6.jpg">http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/9130/1000793gw6.jpg</A>

I can then quickly skip parts of a podcast that I don't like. Neat, eh? You
should be able to try the enhanced podcast thing in iTunes and on any iPod
supporting podcasts (you do have to copy the enhanced podcast to your iPod
using iTunes though). It comes in really handy with longer podcasts such as
the Best of Chris Moyles Show Podcast (
<A HREF="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio1/moylesen/rss.xml">http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio1/moylesen/rss.xml</A>).

&gt;<i> Hello, Pieter!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I installed libgpod v0.6.0 manually today. Guess what, I finally have
</I>&gt;<i> write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's great. Now gPodder has experimental support for the iPod Touch :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the downside, the track processing is slow as hell because of the
</I>&gt;<i> whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SSH thing. I also tried transferring a podcast to my player using
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The app was stuck on the &quot;Completed: podcast x&quot; screen for some time but
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually got a message saying that my podcasts were copied to my
</I>&gt;<i> device. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then found out that libgpod had reset some of the artwork in my database
</I>&gt;<i> (on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which I had spent a few days customizing) to its defaults. Ah well,
</I>&gt;<i> that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the price of using beta software I guess. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The delay after sync is caused by gPodder when it calls the &quot;sync&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> command from the OS. This is done so all caches get flushed and all data
</I>&gt;<i> written to disk. In case someone disconnects the MP3 player or iPod from
</I>&gt;<i> the USB port, the data will not be lost, because all pending writes have
</I>&gt;<i> been flushed to the disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> libgpod is to blame for the broken artwork (I guess ;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, in conclusion: gPodder can copy podcasts to my device, but it takes
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little longer than usual. I haven't been able to fully test gPodder's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality yet but I'll try to do that over the next couple of days
</I>&gt;<i> as I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go about my usual podcast listening routines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neat. Sounds interesting. If you mount the iPod via ssh, does this mean
</I>&gt;<i> that you can wirelessly copy podcasts to your iPod or is it still
</I>&gt;<i> connected via USB?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By the way, gPodder doesn't seem to handle enhanced podcasts (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast</A>) such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/">http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/</A> the proper way. Why is
</I>&gt;<i> that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The link you sent from cbcradio3 only contains MP3 files, maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced podcast feed is something different? From what I read on the
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia page, an enhanced podcast is simply a Quicktime movie file,
</I>&gt;<i> which I guess should work on the iPod just normally. Try syncing the
</I>&gt;<i> feed via iTunes and then via gPodder, and if there is a difference,
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder has to set some flags in the iTunesDB for the iPod to recognize
</I>&gt;<i> the new &quot;type&quot; of podcast (btw: wikipedia also states that this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;enhanced podcast&quot; thing is quite new and unsupported. I could imagine
</I>&gt;<i> the videos to not even play correctly/at all when one does not have the
</I>&gt;<i> quicktime player installed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
