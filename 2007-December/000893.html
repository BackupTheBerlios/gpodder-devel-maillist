<PRE>&gt;<i> Sounds good?
</I>You bet! All these small features you develop do make a difference,
they make people feel really good about the program they're using as
everything is taken care of for them.

And you know what that means, don't you? If there was a Windows
version of libgpod and you were to continue porting gPodder to
Windows, it'd become the best podcatcher around for Windows, beating
iTunes and still having iPod synchronization features! No one - well,
Apple came close - has ever managed to develop a full-featured
user-friendly podcatcher that supports iPods. Until just now. Does
Apple continue improving their podcatcher? No. Do they listen to user
feedback? Don't think so. Do they even care? Probably not.

Alright, I'm getting a little too enthusiastic here. But I stand by my
point: gPodder totally kicks iTunes' a... - em - butt.
