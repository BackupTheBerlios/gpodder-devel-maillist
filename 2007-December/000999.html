<PRE>Hi,

I'll get to your questions in a bit, but first I want to report something
really annoying. You see, my iPod has the tendency to reset some of my
podcast play statuses at what seems random times. (I'm sure that there's a
trigger for this, though.)

It appears that the play counts of these podcasts hadn't been raised to 1.
After some further investigation, I discovered that *all* play counts on my
iPod are messed up (I might check in with the folks at gtkpod for this
later). Some tracks were supposedly played like 85 times - which is
impossible - but most of them have 0 in the play count field! There's not
much you can do about that, considering that it's probably a
gtkpod/libgpod-related issue. However, you might be able to get the podcast
play statuses working correctly by making gPodder check the play status of a
podcast to set the play count accordingly (i.e. if a podcast has been
played, make sure that its play count is set to 1 and not 0). Is that
possible?

&gt;<i> Is there a special &quot;videos&quot; or &quot;video podcasts&quot; playlist on the iPod
</I>&gt;<i> that can be seen with gtkpod?
</I>
Unfortunately, there isn't.

&gt;<i> What about adding a video to the iPod using gtkpod? Is
</I>&gt;<i> that displayed in the iPod's menus then?
</I>
Okay, so this is strange. I added a new video to my iPod using gtkpod, and
it showed up in the Video menu as normal. I even tried setting the 'Media
type' field (for a list of available options:
<A HREF="http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/3641/listoa4.jpg">http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/3641/listoa4.jpg</A>) from 'Video podcast' to
'Video' to make the video podcast show up in the Video menu but that didn't
help.

This video has been added manually to my iPod library, and this one
*does*show up in the Video menu:

(I also got this video to show up as a video podcast, by the way.)

The video podcast I added to my iPod library using gPodder *doesn't* show up
in the Video menu. You've seen these screenshots before, but I'll give you
the links one more time for your convenience:

I don't see that much of a difference, except for the bitrate and sample
rate. I checked my other video podcasts, they all have their bitrate and
sample rate set to zero. I can change the value in these fields but I doubt
that that would help.

&gt;<i> Now, for the enhanced podcasts: Can you please send me the gtkpod
</I>&gt;<i> screenshots of the properties page of a track that has been synced from
</I>&gt;<i> both iTunes and gPodder, just like you did for the video podcasts above?
</I>
This enhanced podcast has been copied to my iPod using iTunes:

This enhanced podcast has been copied to my iPod by gPodder:

I can't help but notice that the sample rate and bitrate are once again set
to 0. Hmm... Oh by the way, I believe that your iPod mini also supports
enhanced podcasts. It might be easier to investigate this if you can play
with it yourself too, you know. :)

&gt;<i> Are enhanced podcasts added correctly when adding the single downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> file from the feed (m4a) using gtkpod?
</I>
I can add them to my iPod manually but my iPod acts as if it was a regular
podcast, just like with any enhanced podcast I copied to my iPod using
gPodder. Does that mean that this is a libgpod-related issue?
