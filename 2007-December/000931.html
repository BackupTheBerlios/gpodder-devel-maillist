Oh, yes this probably happens when syncing to the iPod two times:

1.) Episode gets copied to iPod, marked played locally
2.) Episode &quot;already on iPod&quot;, but played locally and not on iPod
    -&gt; mark played on iPod

Maybe we should disable the play state sync from PC to iPod when the
&quot;mark as played after syncing&quot; feature is enabled?
