<PRE>Hi Thomas and fellow gPodders!

Since the introduction of the new episode selection dialog and the
option to remove old episodes I have been wanting to have the ability to
lock episodes so that they cannot be deleted.  This is because some
podcasts I would like to keep and I don't want to have to deselect them
each time in the remove old episodes dialog selection list.

I have attached a patch that achieves this, you can lock/unlock episodes
in all the ways that you can mark them as played, unplayed etc.  They
will have a 'padlock' as an icon to signify that the episode is locked.

I would appreciate your feedback and comments, and if positive perhaps
this can be rolled into the next release?

(This patch should be applied to the the SVN trunk revision 484)

Regards

Paul
