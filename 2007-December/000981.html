<PRE>Hello, Bernd!

Yes, that's a known problem, I think. Please add it to the TODO list at 
<A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo</A>

&gt;<i> Would be great if there is the possibility to sort the channel list by
</I>&gt;<i> alphabet.
</I>
This feature is already implemented in the latest version of gPodder 
(0.10.3). You can see if you distribution has a new package or try out 
the SVN version.

Instructions are at <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/running-from-svn">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/running-from-svn</A>

&gt;<i> Would be great if there is the possibility to classify the channels in
</I>&gt;<i> the channel list by categories. If you have a big list of channels, it's
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to keep track of.
</I>
I think someone has mentioned this already, but it has not been 
implemented yet. Maybe someone wants to volunteer? Please add this as a 
wishlist item to <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo</A>

&gt;<i> Would be great if there is the possibility to sort the episodes by
</I>&gt;<i> Status/Episode/Size/Released/Description.
</I>
It is currently sorted by &quot;date released&quot;. I think this is the most 
obvious way of sorting episodes. If you are talking about deleting old, 
played episodes there is a better feature already in gPodder 0.10.3: The 
episode selector. I really don't see a point in sorting by description. 
The rest (Status, Size) might be added, but I have no time to do it 
right now, so you are better off adding this to the TODO list on the 
wiki, too: <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo</A>


Enjoy,
Thomas
