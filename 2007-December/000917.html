Can you reproduce this problem now?

gPodder uses the playcount file to &quot;detect&quot; played episodes and will
mark these episodes played locally and also mark it played on the iPod
if it has been played before.

Do you mean that gPodder re-sets the playcount to zero or do you mean
that gPodder removes the &quot;blue&quot; dot before the episode? That's two
different fields in the iTunesDB.
