<PRE>Hi Thomas

I like the tweaks you have made especially with the little padlock
icon....this is what I wanted to do but did not know how!  

As I mentioned in an earlier post I am a novice with Linux based
programming so my solutions are not necessarily elegant, but I am
learning as I go along!  As gPodder is one of the applications I use
daily I figured this was a great project to get started with!

Paul

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would appreciate your feedback and comments, and if positive perhaps

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A great idea, and the patch is very good, only had to change some small
