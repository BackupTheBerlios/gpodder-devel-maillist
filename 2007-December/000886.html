I have found a bug in the code I sent you, you cannot delete a single
unlocked episode!  

As I am not sure how to create a patch of a patch, I created a patch
file for gui.py from rev 484 so it includes all previous changes. But
just in case I have created the patch incorrectly, the relevant section
is in function on_btnDownloadedDelete_clicked, and the following line is
added prior to counting the number of locked episodes.

+        if selection.count_selected_rows() &gt; 1:

Basically the logic to handle multiple selections stopped a single
selection from working!  Sorry!

Paul
