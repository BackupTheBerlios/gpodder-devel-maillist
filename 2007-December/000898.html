<PRE>  **I dunno, its working fin for me, again, too**

Its only when running it through the command line.  Adding its always 
fine, &amp;right now it sems fine too.  Nuking the sqlite dbs.  BTW, they 
are sqlite dbs right?

Then, I've really meant that I've been wanting to work on gPodder more. 
&amp;This morning I'm ready to add it to my project list.  LOL, I mean I'm 
sure gPodder isn't all you work on.  *hopes not*.  We all wok on tons of 
projects &amp;as much work as I've spent writing an entire PHP program just 
as a helper app.  Well its time I made the jump, even though I pretty 
much hate Python, but not enough not to use it.  Now if gPodder were 
written in Java I'd be running the other way; no seriously.

But okay, how should I start?  I'll prolly be intergrating syncing with 
command line option.  I'm guessing I'll prolly have to write my own 
function, method, whatever(other wise you'd have implemented it 
already).  Of course I'll start with checking out svn version, which I'm 
planning on developing and running as --local.  Any coding conventions 
that you enforce?(those might make me run, LOL... just maybe).  After 
some cli stuff I'll finish my barely started playlist 
manager(s)/creator.  Well I hope I can help.

thnx again Thomas, for a girl in oss, you've really been an awesome 
project lead.  A very different experience than I've had with many other 
oss projects.  So just thnx &amp;I hope no one'll hate that I like fun, 
pretty, &amp;documented code.  *hugs*. &amp;If you don't really need or want the 
help right now - no worrries but I'd love to get involved.  As long as 
its okay that, at least for now, gPodder won't be my main project.  But 
as much as I use it I'm sure it will raise in president quickly.  I've 
prolly explained myself enough &amp;I hope your project runs as focused on 
fun as this mailing list makes it seem.  Have a great day!

&amp;To everyone else: yes I'll still be posting my PHP helper program. I'll 
be doing that in a few hours @most.  Right now body need coffee.
