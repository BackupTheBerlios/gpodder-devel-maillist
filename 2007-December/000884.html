<PRE>Hello, Paul!

A great idea, and the patch is very good, only had to change some small
parts and re-factor and re-fine the patch at certain spots. I've
attached your patch with some changes I've made. Please apply this patch
to your working copy and tell me how it works for you.

After I've got some feedback for your patch here, I'd be glad to merge
it into our SVN repository.

Thanks,
Thomas
