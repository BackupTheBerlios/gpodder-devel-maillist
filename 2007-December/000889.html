Well, the idea itself was very clever, I haven't thought about &quot;locking&quot;
episodes, but it really makes sense, and can be used in combination with
other ideas (automatic clean-up).

Even if the solutions would not be very elegant (your patch was nearly
perfect, apart from some minor things), the idea and the time invested
in implementing the patch is already very helpful and motivating.

I'll keep your patch around for a few more days to give other people
time to comment on it and then merge it into our SVN repository.

Thanks,
Thomas
