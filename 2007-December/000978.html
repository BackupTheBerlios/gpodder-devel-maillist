I'm glad you like it :) We're actively improving gPodder, and the 
discussions take place here on the mailing list, so any annoyances you 
have with gPodder can be discussed (and hopefully fixed) here :)

&gt;<i> Is it possible to mark an episode as new. I added a new feed and only the last 
</I>&gt;<i> episode is marked as new. But I would like to mark all episodes in a new added 
</I>&gt;<i> feed as new How can I do this? I didn't found an option in the GUI. Is there
</I>&gt;<i> a chance to do this in a &quot;config file&quot; or &quot;behind the scenes&quot;?
</I>
Open ~/.config/gpodder/gpodder.conf and set the &quot;default_new&quot; 
configuration option from 1 to some insanely high value (1000). gPodder 
will then mark the 1000 newest episodes of a channel as &quot;new&quot;, which 
practically means that gPodder will consider all episodes as &quot;new&quot;.

&gt;<i> The second question is similar. I would like to mark an non downloaded episode 
</I>&gt;<i> as played? I listened a lot of episodes in another podcatcher - program before 
</I>&gt;<i> and now I would like to mark these episodes as played. Is this possible? Here I 
</I>&gt;<i> also didn't find any option in the GUI.
</I>
Either download the episodes, select all relevant episodes, then 
right-click and &quot;mark selected episodes as played&quot; or add the download 
URLs of the corresponding episodes to the 
~/.config/gpodder/playback-history.txt file, which is a simple text file 
that contains the download URLs of an episode (the URL in the 
&lt;enclosure&gt; tag) - one per line.


Good luck!
Thomas
