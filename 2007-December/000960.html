If you get to try it, please report back here if it works and what needs 
to be done to get it working.

If you are into open source, something like the Nokia N800 might be a 
better option, if you want some WiFi-capable, small gadget that can play 
music and videos (although I don't know about the video quality or 
playback performance of the N800). That one surely works with gPodder, 
and some guy even ported a (now outdated) old version of gPodder to the 
N800, so some N800 owners were able to run gPodder directly on their 
portable device ;)
