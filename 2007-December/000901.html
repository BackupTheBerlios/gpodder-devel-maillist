<PRE>Hello!

I've just released a new version of gPodder. This release adds a bunch
of features that have appeared in our SVN repository after the last
release and also adds an important bugfix.

Compared to the previous releases, this release has happened a bit early
into the month, which should give us some more time to prepare the new
sync code (which will allow more features and CLI sync) until late
January (at least that's what I hope :).

Below are the release notes from the gPodder website. You can find
download links on <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/downloads.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/downloads.html</A>

Enjoy!
Thomas

==================
gPodder 0.10.3 &quot;A Stop at Willoughby&quot; released

It's not yet the end of December, but as the week between christmas and
my birthday tends to be busy, I decided to push out this release earlier
in the month. After all, this release contains an important bug fix for
a bug that appeared in 0.10.2 and prevented first-time users from adding
a new channel. Still, in these few weeks, we've added a bunch of good
features that will make your gPodder experience even better (or at least
that's what we hope..).

Highlights of this release include the new pill in the channel
navigator: A graphical representation of the numer of unplayed vs.
downloaded episodes. This feature is based on an idea by Paul Rudkin
from November. Another change to make life with strange podcast authors
easier is the ability to directly add iTunes Podcast links (the ones
starting with <A HREF="http://phobos.apple.com/...">http://phobos.apple.com/...</A>) to the channel list - gPodder
will take care of &quot;resolving&quot; the correct podcast RSS URL. You can now
delete single episodes from your iPod from within gPodder (not yet
available for MP3 players, though). A very cool feature has been
suggested by Paul Rudkin, who also did the initial patch: Episodes can
now be locked, so they can not be removed from the gPodder GUI. These
&quot;locked&quot; episode will also be hidden from the Delete old episodes
dialog. See below for the complete list of new features and changes.

Teo Ramirez was kind enough to take the time to translate gPodder to
Galician, so we now have gPodder translatins for English and 10 other
languages. PayPal donations are always very nice. This month, John
Charrette sent a donation - Thanks! And don't forget to visit the new
gPodder Wiki that is updated more often and now also hosts our Feature
Requests list.

As always, you can grab your tarball from the downloads page, view new
screenshots on the screenshots page or wait for your distribution vendor
to update the gPodder package. Enjoy!
