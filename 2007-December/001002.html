Which version of gPodder are you using?

The items only stay on the list as long as the deleted episodes are 
available from the public podcast feed. As soon as the episode 
disappears from the public RSS feed, gPodder will stop showing the 
deleted episode.

gPodder displays the list of available episodes (from the feed) and also 
displays downloaded episodes that have been removed from the public feed 
already.

If you are annoyed by the trash can icon, you can right-click on the 
episode and select &quot;mark as not downloaded/deleted&quot;, which will make the 
episode disappear as if if has never been downloaded/deleted.

I hope that clarifies the &quot;trash can&quot; feature. Hiding deleted episodes 
would only make the code and user interface more complicated without 
adding many benefits for the user.

Be sure to use the latest gPodder version (currently 0.10.3) to get the 
right-click menu for episodes.

Enjoy,
Thomas
