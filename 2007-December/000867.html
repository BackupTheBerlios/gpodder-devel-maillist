<PRE>Hi,

Now that I come to think of it: why don't you use the download date (=
file creation date) instead? Here's why:
- Some people like to dive into show archives to listen back to old
episodes. If you delete episodes based on their production date,
gPodder deletes them before you get to listen to them. That is, unless
you only delete played episodes. But still.
- This would provide a perfect and super-subtle workaround for feeds
without timestamps. The user won't notice the difference.

It's killing two birds with one stone! What are your thoughts on this?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would, but it doesn't seem that user-friendly. What if the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wants to delete all podcasts older than two weeks, for example?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should move this into a preference. Something like &quot;Episodes
</I>&gt;<i> are considered old after [___] days&quot;. That's because I want to add the
</I>&gt;<i> episode clean-up feature for the iPod as well, and so all &quot;clean-up&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> code could use the same settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Sorting by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pubDate would also be possible, but there are (again, broken) feeds that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; do not have any pubDate value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's a bummer. You could solve this by implementing a cleaner that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't delete undated episodes and keeping the current episode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deletion feature in gPodder. Or you could develop an auto-cleaner (can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be configured in the Settings window) and leave the episode deletion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature as it is. Would that provide a good workaround to the broken
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feed problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What speaks against the current implementation with a new button &quot;remove
</I>&gt;<i> old episodes&quot; with the time range for &quot;old&quot; defined in the preferences
</I>&gt;<i> dialog? We can always implement it so that episodes without timestamp
</I>&gt;<i> are just ignored (i.e. they have to be checked manually).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
