<PRE>Hi Thomas

For sometime I have been having an issue every time I edit preferences.
The symptoms of the problem are basically that I have previously set the
download folder to be '/home/paul/Podcasts'.  However every time I load
up the preferences dialog the download folder browser button showed my
download directory directory as 'paul'.   

As a consequence when I closed the preference GUI the software acted as
if there was a change and kind of attempted to move my podcasts, however
fortunately it always failed and gave an error.

I took a look at the code and I have attached a patch that seems to
work.  Instead of setting the file name property of the folder browser I
set the current folder.  This has the desired affect.  I also updated
the code for the Torrent folder selection and iPod/MP3 folder selection
as these seemed to exhibit the same problem.

I think this maybe related to the problem Chris Arnold reported on
Wednesday
