<PRE>I installed libgpod v0.6.0 manually today. Guess what, I finally have write
access!
(This is weird though: <A HREF="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/9163/touchhs9.jpg.">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/9163/touchhs9.jpg.</A>
Why does it say 'read-only'?)

On the downside, the track processing is slow as hell because of the whole
SSH thing. I also tried transferring a podcast to my player using gPodder.
The app was stuck on the &quot;Completed: podcast x&quot; screen for some time but I
eventually got a message saying that my podcasts were copied to my device. I
then found out that libgpod had reset some of the artwork in my database (on
which I had spent a few days customizing) to its defaults. Ah well, that's
the price of using beta software I guess. :)

So, in conclusion: gPodder can copy podcasts to my device, but it takes a
little longer than usual. I haven't been able to fully test gPodder's
functionality yet but I'll try to do that over the next couple of days as I
go about my usual podcast listening routines.

By the way, gPodder doesn't seem to handle enhanced podcasts (
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast</A>) such as
<A HREF="http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/">http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/</A> the proper way. Why is that?

&gt;<i> Hi Thomas,

</I>&gt;<i> Here's the strange thing: when selecting my iPod model in gtkpod, the

</I>&gt;<i> read/write mode for all users. I have installed both libgpod v0.6.0 and
</I>&gt;<i> v0.4.2 (both DEB packages; libgpod3 and libgpod1 respectively) but I'll

</I>&gt;<i> library to my Touch. I'll get back to you in a few days or so.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello, Pieter!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pieter De Decker wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So right now, *it's impossible* to use gPodder with the iPod touch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; According to <A HREF="http://gtkpod.wikispaces.com/Sysinfo+File">http://gtkpod.wikispaces.com/Sysinfo+File</A> writing songs to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the iPod touch _should_ work. You might need to get the latest libgpod
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and gtkpod source. I bet it's best to first try to get gtkpod to copy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; songs to the iPod touch and then build libgpod's Python bindings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install it so that it can be seen by gPodder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  From what I've read on the web, you need to save the Firewire ID of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your iPod Touch somewhere in a SysInfo file (described in the above
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; link) to enable gtkpod to &quot;sign&quot; the iTunesDB with the right checksum,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so the iPod will accept the songs. Also, after uploading songs to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iPod, you might need to do the following (quoting from the link above):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &quot;To make them appear press and hold the &quot;Home&quot;-Button until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    springboard is reloaded. Going to &quot;Music&quot; now will show your music.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'll have to keep an eye on the libgpod project but for now, I won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; use gPodder any longer. I'll be back as soon as the Touch gets write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; though. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope you'll be able to get libgpod running with your iPod Touch really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon (as far as I can see from the web sites, it's already possible, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs some fiddling). We really like to keep you in the gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community, as you've been very helpful in testing out features and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; giving suggestions and improving code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And last but not least, when libgpod finally works, you would be our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iPod Touch expert, so we could throw any questions related to gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the iPod Touch in your direction ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good luck!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thomas
