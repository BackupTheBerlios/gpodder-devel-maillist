Looking at

<A HREF="http://webcvs.cairographics.org/pycairo/NEWS?revision=1.20&amp;view=markup">http://webcvs.cairographics.org/pycairo/NEWS?revision=1.20&amp;view=markup</A>

I see that in &quot;Overview of changes from pycairo 1.0.2 to pycairo 1.1.6&quot;, 
write_to_png() has been changed to write to file-like objects:

     surface.write_to_png() and ImageSurface.create_from_png() can
     now write to file-like objects (like StringIO).

This means that starting from pycairo 1.1.6, gPodder will work as 
expected. Unfortunately, I can't provide support for a commercial 
distribution like SuSE Linux, where I wouldn't be able to get some code 
to test things, and I believe OpenSuSE already has newer versions of 
these packages.

Things will work with the patch I sent you some days ago, if you decide 
to stick with the old pycairo version. As soon as you update your 
distribution to a newer release (or pycairo is updated for your 
release), things should start working without problems.

If you don't miss the new features and can live with the bugs, you can 
also downgrade to gPodder 0.10.2. Please note this is not really a &quot;bug&quot; 
in gPodder, but simply a downwards compatibility issue of pycairo. 
gPodder uses a feature (write_to_png being able to write to a StringIO 
object) that has only been added to pycairo in version 1.1.6).

Maybe upgrading to pycairo 1.1.6 is possible for you without breaking 
other PyGTK apps, compared to upgrading to 1.4.x? If you can find a 
pycairo package &gt;= 1.1.6 for your distribution, and it works, you win :)

I hope this kind of answers your question, although it surely isn't the 
answer you were probably hoping for :/


Enjoy,
Thomas
