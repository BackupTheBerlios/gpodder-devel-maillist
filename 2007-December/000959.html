Thanks for your report. One thing I quickly noticed when testing your 
feed is that you do not use the &quot;length=&quot; attribute of the enclosure 
elements correctly. The &quot;length=&quot; attribute should be the number of 
bytes of the file to be downloaded, not a media length or something.

That said, I tried downloading the most recent episode and it works 
quite well.

I could imagine the problem being related to the new URLs. If a feed 
doesn't provide GUIDs, gPodder will use the download URL as unique 
identifier for an episode. When the URL changes, gPodder might not be 
able to correctly identify old downloads and see the episodes already 
downloaded as &quot;new&quot;. This problem could be prevented if you have 
provided GUIDs before and after the URL migration.

Workaround: The users that are affected by this change should just 
download the newest episode from your feed. gPodder should then only 
offer to download new episodes that have been published _after_ the 
newest episode.

Hope that helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to reply.

Thomas
