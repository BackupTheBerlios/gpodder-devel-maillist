According to <A HREF="http://gtkpod.wikispaces.com/Sysinfo+File">http://gtkpod.wikispaces.com/Sysinfo+File</A> writing songs to 
the iPod touch _should_ work. You might need to get the latest libgpod 
and gtkpod source. I bet it's best to first try to get gtkpod to copy 
songs to the iPod touch and then build libgpod's Python bindings and 
install it so that it can be seen by gPodder.

 From what I've read on the web, you need to save the Firewire ID of 
your iPod Touch somewhere in a SysInfo file (described in the above 
link) to enable gtkpod to &quot;sign&quot; the iTunesDB with the right checksum, 
so the iPod will accept the songs. Also, after uploading songs to your 
iPod, you might need to do the following (quoting from the link above):

   &quot;To make them appear press and hold the &quot;Home&quot;-Button until the
    springboard is reloaded. Going to &quot;Music&quot; now will show your music.&quot;

&gt;<i> I'll have to keep an eye on the libgpod project but for now, I won't be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> use gPodder any longer. I'll be back as soon as the Touch gets write support 
</I>&gt;<i> though. :)
</I>
I hope you'll be able to get libgpod running with your iPod Touch really 
soon (as far as I can see from the web sites, it's already possible, but 
needs some fiddling). We really like to keep you in the gPodder 
community, as you've been very helpful in testing out features and 
giving suggestions and improving code.

And last but not least, when libgpod finally works, you would be our 
iPod Touch expert, so we could throw any questions related to gPodder 
and the iPod Touch in your direction ;)

Good luck!

Thomas
