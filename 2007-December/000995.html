<PRE>Hello, Pieter!

Ok, I think we can fix this with a bit trial-and-error and probably some 
iTunesDB-related changes. It just needs some of your time to help :)

&gt;<i> This podcast has been transferred to my player using iTunes and does show up

 From the screenshots, I can't see much difference, except for the 
bitrate that is set. One thing that might be related to this is that for 
video podcasts, we need to add the track to a special playlist. Is there 
a special &quot;videos&quot; or &quot;video podcasts&quot; playlist on the iPod that can be 
seen with gtkpod? What about adding a video to the iPod using gtkpod? Is 
that displayed in the iPod's menus then?

&gt;<i> By the way, I added a page to the gPodder wiki about the iPod touch. You can
</I>&gt;<i> find it here: <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/ipodtouch">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/ipodtouch</A>
</I>
That's very good. I've linked it from the Wiki's start page under &quot;iPod 
Touch HOWTO&quot;.

Now, for the enhanced podcasts: Can you please send me the gtkpod 
screenshots of the properties page of a track that has been synced from 
both iTunes and gPodder, just like you did for the video podcasts above?

Are enhanced podcasts added correctly when adding the single downloaded 
file from the feed (m4a) using gtkpod?

Thanks,
Thomas
