<PRE>No, I think it happened to me when putting the podcast on my iPod, not
during the second sync. I could be wrong though.

&gt;<i> Maybe we should disable the play state sync from PC to iPod when the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mark as played after syncing&quot; feature is enabled?
</I>Yeah, that would be good idea.

</I>&gt;<i> Oh, yes this probably happens when syncing to the iPod two times:
