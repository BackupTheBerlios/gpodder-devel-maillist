<PRE>Hi Thomas,

&gt;<i> Have you had another look at the playcount issue?
</I>Yes, I have. I found out that tracks that supposedly haven't been played yet
have their 'Date played' field set to '--'. As you mentioned, it's probably
not gPodder's fault. My songs experience the same problems but I never
noticed it before.

&gt;<i>  *) Set the bitrate to zero for &quot;working&quot; videos and see if this
</I>&gt;<i>     breaks them on normal iPods
</I>Nope, this didn't break the video.

&gt;<i>  *) Set the bitrate to some non-zero value (maybe the real bitrate
</I>&gt;<i>    value which you can get by first adding it via gtkpod and looking
</I>&gt;<i>    at the set bitrate, then deleting it via gtkpod and sync via
</I>&gt;<i>    gPodder); then, see if this makes the video appear on the iPod
</I>That didn't work. So the problem has to be somewhere else.

&gt;<i> Maybe you want to write to the gtkpod/libgpod development mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> and ask about the status for iTunesDB chapter support in libgpod.
</I>I might. First, I'm gonna inquiry about the play counts issue though.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 track.mark_unplayed = 0x02
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the issue has to be somewhere else, then. Have you had another
</I>&gt;<i> look at the playcount issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What about adding a video to the iPod using gtkpod? Is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that displayed in the iPod's menus then?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay, so this is strange. I added a new video to my iPod using gtkpod,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it showed up in the Video menu as normal. I even tried setting the
</I>&gt;<i> 'Media
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type' field (for a list of available options:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/3641/listoa4.jpg">http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/3641/listoa4.jpg</A>) from 'Video podcast'
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'Video' to make the video podcast show up in the Video menu but that
</I>&gt;<i> didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This video has been added manually to my iPod library, and this one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *does*show up in the Video menu:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I also got this video to show up as a video podcast, by the way.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The video podcast I added to my iPod library using gPodder *doesn't*
</I>&gt;<i> show up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the Video menu. You've seen these screenshots before, but I'll give
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the links one more time for your convenience:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see that much of a difference, except for the bitrate and sample
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rate. I checked my other video podcasts, they all have their bitrate and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sample rate set to zero. I can change the value in these fields but I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that that would help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, even if the bitrate and samplerate are set to zero, the video
</I>&gt;<i> podcast works? Maybe the iPod relies on the video bitrate. Please try
</I>&gt;<i> these two things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *) Set the bitrate to zero for &quot;working&quot; videos and see if this
</I>&gt;<i>     breaks them on normal iPods
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *) Set the bitrate to some non-zero value (maybe the real bitrate
</I>&gt;<i>     value which you can get by first adding it via gtkpod and looking
</I>&gt;<i>     at the set bitrate, then deleting it via gtkpod and sync via
</I>&gt;<i>     gPodder); then, see if this makes the video appear on the iPod
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can't help but notice that the sample rate and bitrate are once again
</I>&gt;<i> set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to 0. Hmm... Oh by the way, I believe that your iPod mini also supports
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enhanced podcasts. It might be easier to investigate this if you can
</I>&gt;<i> play
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with it yourself too, you know. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will try as soon as I reboot into OS X. Sadly, I'm still at 64k ISDN
</I>&gt;<i> here at home, so downloading anything bigger than 10 MiB fastly mutates
</I>&gt;<i> into a day job ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Are enhanced podcasts added correctly when adding the single downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; file from the feed (m4a) using gtkpod?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can add them to my iPod manually but my iPod acts as if it was a
</I>&gt;<i> regular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; podcast, just like with any enhanced podcast I copied to my iPod using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gPodder. Does that mean that this is a libgpod-related issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is, after doing some research on the web myself. The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;chapter&quot; data (as seen on <A HREF="http://ipodlinux.org/ITunesDB">http://ipodlinux.org/ITunesDB</A>) in the
</I>&gt;<i> iTunesDB holds information about the chapters. From what I read on the
</I>&gt;<i> web, iTunes extracts the chapter information from the m4a files and
</I>&gt;<i> writes it into the iTunesDB. libgpod/gtkpod only has support for &quot;raw&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> chapter files, meaning that it will not destroy chapter data (read raw,
</I>&gt;<i> write raw) that is in the iTunesDB, but it also means that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> way of &quot;construction&quot; chapter data in the iTunesDB. And even if it _was_
</I>&gt;<i> possible, it would still mean that we would have to extract chapter data
</I>&gt;<i> from the m4a files, parse it correctly and then prepare and inject it
</I>&gt;<i> into the iTunesDB file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you want to write to the gtkpod/libgpod development mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> and ask about the status for iTunesDB chapter support in libgpod.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck!
