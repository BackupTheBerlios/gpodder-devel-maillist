<PRE>Hello Thomas,

thanks for the fast and helpful reply! Both solutions worked for me.
After working a little bit with gPodder I have found one error and 3
feature wishes (my gPodder version is 0.10.1):

1)
The error occur if you define a SMB/CIF directory for &quot;download_dir&quot; in
the settings Dialog. Every tested local dir worked, but no SMB-dir. I
tried to set the SMB-dir directly in the settings-file
(~/.config/gpodder/gpodder.conf) and this solution worked. But so you
are losing the functionality, that gPodder copies all channel-files
(downloaded episodes, channel-cover, channel-xml) to the new location.
It would be great if you could review this error. I think it's an
important feature, because there are sure a few people out there, who
are stored there data directly on a NAS or SMB-Share.

2)
Would be great if there is the possibility to sort the channel list by
alphabet.

3)
Would be great if there is the possibility to classify the channels in
the channel list by categories. If you have a big list of channels, it's
difficult to keep track of.

4)
Would be great if there is the possibility to sort the episodes by
Status/Episode/Size/Released/Description.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Open ~/.config/gpodder/gpodder.conf and set the &quot;default_new&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> practically means that gPodder will consider all episodes as &quot;new&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The second question is similar. I would like to mark an non downloaded episode 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as played? I listened a lot of episodes in another podcatcher - program before 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and now I would like to mark these episodes as played. Is this possible? Here I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also didn't find any option in the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Either download the episodes, select all relevant episodes, then 
</I>&gt;<i> right-click and &quot;mark selected episodes as played&quot; or add the download 
</I>&gt;<i> URLs of the corresponding episodes to the 
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.config/gpodder/playback-history.txt file, which is a simple text file 
</I>&gt;<i> that contains the download URLs of an episode (the URL in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;enclosure&gt; tag) - one per line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck!
