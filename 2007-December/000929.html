<PRE>Hi again,

A few days ago (before my play counts got messed up), I noticed that
something might be wrong with the 'Mark as played after syncing' feature.
After giving it a spin, I saw that gPodder had marked new podcasts as played
in gPodder as well as on my iPod, while it should have marked them as played
in gPodder and unplayed on my iPod.

Is this a bug or did I just space out? (I'd try to reproduce it but I'm
gonna have to fix my iPod first to be able to do that. I'm thinking about
backing up my iTunesDB and then formatting the device. I'll check for
firmware updates first though.)

Pieter
