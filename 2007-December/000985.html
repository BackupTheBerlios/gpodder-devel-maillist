<PRE>Hello, Pieter!

That's great. Now gPodder has experimental support for the iPod Touch :)

&gt;<i> On the downside, the track processing is slow as hell because of the whole
</I>&gt;<i> SSH thing. I also tried transferring a podcast to my player using gPodder.
</I>&gt;<i> The app was stuck on the &quot;Completed: podcast x&quot; screen for some time but I
</I>&gt;<i> eventually got a message saying that my podcasts were copied to my device. I
</I>&gt;<i> then found out that libgpod had reset some of the artwork in my database (on
</I>&gt;<i> which I had spent a few days customizing) to its defaults. Ah well, that's
</I>&gt;<i> the price of using beta software I guess. :)
</I>
The delay after sync is caused by gPodder when it calls the &quot;sync&quot; 
command from the OS. This is done so all caches get flushed and all data 
written to disk. In case someone disconnects the MP3 player or iPod from 
the USB port, the data will not be lost, because all pending writes have 
been flushed to the disk.

libgpod is to blame for the broken artwork (I guess ;).

&gt;<i> So, in conclusion: gPodder can copy podcasts to my device, but it takes a
</I>&gt;<i> little longer than usual. I haven't been able to fully test gPodder's
</I>&gt;<i> functionality yet but I'll try to do that over the next couple of days as I
</I>&gt;<i> go about my usual podcast listening routines.
</I>
Neat. Sounds interesting. If you mount the iPod via ssh, does this mean 
that you can wirelessly copy podcasts to your iPod or is it still 
connected via USB?

&gt;<i> By the way, gPodder doesn't seem to handle enhanced podcasts (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast</A>) such as
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/">http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/trackoftheday/</A> the proper way. Why is that?
</I>
The link you sent from cbcradio3 only contains MP3 files, maybe the 
enhanced podcast feed is something different? From what I read on the 
Wikipedia page, an enhanced podcast is simply a Quicktime movie file, 
which I guess should work on the iPod just normally. Try syncing the 
feed via iTunes and then via gPodder, and if there is a difference, 
gPodder has to set some flags in the iTunesDB for the iPod to recognize 
the new &quot;type&quot; of podcast (btw: wikipedia also states that this 
&quot;enhanced podcast&quot; thing is quite new and unsupported. I could imagine 
the videos to not even play correctly/at all when one does not have the 
quicktime player installed).


Thanks,
Thomas
