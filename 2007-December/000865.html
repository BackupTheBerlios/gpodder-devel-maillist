<PRE>Hi Thomas,

&gt;<i> What about adding a &quot;select episodes older than one week&quot; button to the
</I>&gt;<i> episode selector dialog? Would this solve your problem?
</I>It would, but it doesn't seem that user-friendly. What if the user
wants to delete all podcasts older than two weeks, for example?

&gt;<i> Sorting by
</I>&gt;<i> pubDate would also be possible, but there are (again, broken) feeds that
</I>&gt;<i> do not have any pubDate value.
</I>That's a bummer. You could solve this by implementing a cleaner that
doesn't delete undated episodes and keeping the current episode
deletion feature in gPodder. Or you could develop an auto-cleaner (can
be configured in the Settings window) and leave the episode deletion
feature as it is. Would that provide a good workaround to the broken
feed problem?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Number one (user input): &quot;Delete all podcasts older than |USER INPUT| days&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Number two (checkbox): &quot;Don't delete unplayed podcasts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think?
