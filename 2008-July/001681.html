<PRE>Hello there!

I'm glad to announce that the 0.12.0 release cycle was just 9 days, and
we didn't even include all the new changes from trunk in the 0.12.1
release, because we wanted it to be stable and went for a bugfix release
instead (there are the German and French translations updated, but
that's about it).

So, here it is: gPodder 0.12.1 &quot;The Little People&quot; for your
bug-fix-loving podcast needs. The release announcement follows below.

What's next?
We'll be migrating to Git as soon as we find some time to do a clean
migration, we'll be drafting a new road map, because 1.0 isn't going to
happen so soon, especially as we now have many developers actively
working on new features, and the codebase is very dynamic and vital at
the moment, so stopping features from coming into gPodder and preventing
the motivated developers from putting their creative work into gPodder's
code just for the sake of stability would pull out all the fun from this
project. Who would have thought that, huh? ;)

So, until further notice, the 1.0 release is delayed for a few more
months, probably when (if) development slows down a bit. I have no
problem with delaying 1.0 infinitely if that means that we keep working
as motivated as now on gPodder :)

Thanks to all who were involved in the 0.12.1 release!

Enjoy!
Thomas

======================================================

2008-07-24: gPodder 0.12.1 &quot;The Little People&quot; released
After several people have discovered bugs in the 0.12.0 release of
gPodder released last week, we decided to push out a bugfix release, so
you get the best out of gPodder without having to wait for a few weeks
to get back a working gPodder:

      * Fix Device traceback when syncing (reported by FriedBunny, fixed
        by Nick)
      * Fix problems with command-line mode not working correctly
        (reported by Mykola Nikishov)
      * Updated French translation (by Jerome Chabod)

It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest version for the best
gPodder experience.
