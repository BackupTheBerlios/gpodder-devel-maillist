<PRE>Hello!

gPodder 0.12.0 has been rushed out, ready to get some serious testing of
the new code and to pleasure its users with a speedier interface and
backend.

Thanks to all who were involved, be it through bug reports, code
contributions, service management, books and donations.

Download: <A HREF="http://www.gpodder.org/downloads.html">http://www.gpodder.org/downloads.html</A>

We'll do some more planning for upcoming releases in the next few days.

Enjoy,
Thomas

==================

After one and a half months, we're proud to have yet another great
release of your favourite podcatcher for Linux and BSD on the plate.
Enter gPodder 0.12.0. This version features a brand new SQLite backend,
which will speed up the overall user experience of gPodder and make
everything a bit more snappy.

See the Roadmap for release goals and major changes.

A very special thanks goes out to the really great developers without
whom this release would not have been possible: Justin Forest, who did
most of the SQLite code and other contributions, and our two developers
nikosapi and Jerome Chabod. The list of contributors and bug reporters
is so huge that I'm not able to list them here - I'd surely forget
somebody. Please see the detailed changelog linked below for all
contributors for this release.

Thanks to the donators of the gPodder N810 Fundraiser, which will help
develop gPodder on Maemo further - there's still a long way to go, so if
you like gPodder, consider donating there.

Also thanks to the nice people who where kind enough to support my
reading habit by sending a nice book from my wishlist.
