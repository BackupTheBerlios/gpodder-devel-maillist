Please make sure that you remove all gPodder installations (distribution
packages, manual installations into /usr and /usr/local) so that there
is no sign of gPodder packages in both /usr/ and /usr/local/. Then,
after you have made sure that there are no leftovers from previous
installations, do a &quot;make install&quot; if you really want to install it
system-wide.

gPodder also runs fine and without problems locally. Simply create a
script that calls &quot;bin/gpodder --local&quot; in your source folder (put it
somewhere in your home folder) and create a shortcut icon for it. This
way, you don't pollute your system folders with manual installations
(it's easier if one leaves /usr to the distribution's package manager)
and have a working gPodder in your home directory. You can then even use
the SVN version without problems, in case you are in for some new
features and new bugs ;)

Hope that helps!

Thanks,
Thomas
