<PRE>Hi,

The update button is on the bottom to be visually grouped with the
podcast list (principle of proximity) and because the toolbar does not
have to be visible all the time (you can use the main menu or Ctrl+T to
toggle the toolbar's visibility).

The reason for having the status area there while the feed is updating
is to save space on netbook-sized displays and also because the button
would be disabled while an update is taking place, anyway.

&gt;<i> Why are some controls on the top and another one on the bottom? Yes, the

</I>
The controls on the top are not that important and can be accessed via
the menu, and just provide shortcuts, while the &quot;Update&quot; button is
deemed important enough to have its own place, even when the toolbar is
hidden.

&gt;<i> Also, why ditching the status bar? It's a component found on almost
</I>&gt;<i> every piece of software and users will fastly know it's use: show the
</I>&gt;<i> status information.
</I>
We didn't ditch the status bar - there never was one in the first place.
As you can see from your Chromium and Firefox examples, the status bar
is going away, because it's taking up too much screen space. The
implementation of Chromium and Firefox is nice for mouseover information
(target URL), but it's pretty pointless for progress information - for
this, a progressbar is better suited as opposed to text-only.

We're currently working on some major overhaul of the codebase and also
some parts of the UI (including a new QML UI for future touch-based
devices), so it's probably better to postpone this discussion until 3.x
is out. Feel free to create a bug report on bugs.gpodder.org for
discussion and brainstorming of this, though.

Thanks,
Thomas
