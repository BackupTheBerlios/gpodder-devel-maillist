<PRE>Hi Wilfred,

gPodder uses python-gpod, which are the Python bindings to libgpod,
which in turn is the backend code for gtkpod and other applications
(libgpod came out of gtkpod development, and is since available as
separate library).

&gt;<i> The strange thing is that it seems to me that none of the related

</I>&gt;<i> gpodder before, but always it turned out that those problems were due

</I>&gt;<i> the problem: in gpodder, I move all the files to the Desktop, and then
</I>&gt;<i> sync with gtkpod - but of course this is not a good solution.
</I>
If gtkpod works fine, so should libgpod (and in turn python-gpod). Maybe
there really is a problem with track length detection. Maybe you could
try uninstalling eyeD3 or Python Imaging and see if this helps? You
could also try removing mplayer and see if this fixes the problem.

Have you tried syncing single files? Maybe only a specific feed is
affected. Do you sync MP3 files or OGG files? Does gPodder try to
convert the OGG files to MP3? Maybe this is taking a bit long?

Anyway, it would be good if you could file a bug report on
<A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/">http://bugs.gpodder.org/</A> so we can track the progress on fixing this
bug. I'll need your assistance with trying things out, as I don't have
an iPod myself, and it probably isn't that easy to reproduce your
specific configuration for which it happens.


Thanks,
Thomas
