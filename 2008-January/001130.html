<PRE>Dear developers and users of gPodder,
I've just added some points to the ToDo list.

I put them under a new headline &quot;Items under discussion&quot;:

     * Sort episodes by Status/Episode/Size/Released (by Bernd Schlapsi)
I would really appreciate to have a sorting option. I sometimes add new
feeds because I read somewhere that it features some interesting topic
months ago. I would then download it and like to have the possibility to
find all feeds by status. A sort by size is helpful if your external
player is running out of disk space and you would like to see which
podcasts would still fit on the memory.
     * Show playtime additionally to episode size It would be helpful to
have a option to show the total playing time of a episonde because feeds
can use a different encoding and bitrate. The actual file size doesn't
tell much of the play duration of the respective media file.
     * Prioritize Podcasts Let's say you have already downloaded 3 GB of
episodes. If your external player only has ha memory of 1 or 2 GB you
may just want the 2GB filled with the episodes of the podcasts you like
most. This could be implemented as follows:
         ** drag&amp;drop prioritizing: change the order of the feeds in the
left pane (currently alphabetically)
         ** mark certain feeds and episodes as &quot;important&quot; like in liferea.
     =&gt; prioritized items would then be synchronized first.

I hope you appreciate these ideas.

Thanks for creating such a nice app!

Kind regards,
Timmie
