<PRE>OK, firstly I apologise for not changing the topic from the default. I
only noticed afterwards and maybe changing it now is actually a bad
idea.

Anyway, I agree with you about not having too many buttons on the
notification bar, but I do think that the downloading should still be
automatic when gpodder is minimized to the tray. It is nice to open it
again later and have all your episodes there. Maybe adding a download
automatically option is a good idea.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree completly with you. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I propose to modify the tray icon this way:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When new episodes are found:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * the option &quot;auto-dowload new episodes&quot; is ON: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     - notify &quot;x new episodes where found. Download will start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; immediatly...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     - notification as 2 buttons &quot;cancel&quot; and &quot;show&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     - after 5 s, if cancel wasn't pressed, download starts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automaticaly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * the option &quot;auto-dowload new episodes&quot; is OFF: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     - notify &quot;x new episodes where found&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     - notification as 3 buttons &quot;download all news&quot;, &quot;select episodes&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and &quot;show&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you and other people thing about that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think all these special cases make configuring and using gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> harder than it should be. I agree with you on the problems with gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> popping up randomly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of &quot;auto-download new episodes&quot; is that a user that wants to
</I>&gt;<i> download new episodes doesn't have to click on &quot;download new episodes&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> after clicking &quot;refresh feeds&quot;, so the menu item would better be
</I>&gt;<i> described as &quot;auto-download new episodes after a manual feed update&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which would already tell us the way to go. In my opinion, when gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> is minimized to the tray icon, it should only tell the user that new
</I>&gt;<i> episodes are available or that downloads have been finished. Although
</I>&gt;<i> the buttons in the notification bubble are nice, I think they are a bad
</I>&gt;<i> idea for interacting the way we use it currently. The buttons in the
</I>&gt;<i> notification area are more useful for things like &quot;don't show me this
</I>&gt;<i> again&quot; or in case of an error &quot;show the logfile&quot; or such things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interaction with gPodder should only happen when it is not minimized. If
</I>&gt;<i> you are letting yourself be distracted by the notification bubble (and
</I>&gt;<i> try to read and click on it), you might as well only get a notification
</I>&gt;<i> and if you want to act upon it, open gPodder and carry out the actions
</I>&gt;<i> you want to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The timeout in the notification bubbles with action buttons also gives a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hurry, hurry - you have to do something now!&quot; kind of feeling - same
</I>&gt;<i> with instant messengers - that surely interrupt the normal workflow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion, we should throw out the action buttons completely and
</I>&gt;<i> make gPodder behave nice and non-intrusive when minimized. This means:
</I>&gt;<i> only notification bubbles for the following scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * New episodes are available
</I>&gt;<i>  * Downloads have been finished
</I>&gt;<i>  (did I forget something here?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the &quot;new episodes are available&quot; notification should only be shown
</I>&gt;<i> once, not every time the feed cache gets updated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When gPodder is minimized, updating the feed cache (automatically or
</I>&gt;<i> manually) should never trigger an automatic download. The option
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned above should only come into effect when the feed update was
</I>&gt;<i> initiated manually and gPodder was not minimized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? Anybody willing to implement it this way? I still
</I>&gt;<i> want to do the new sync code, so any help with fixing the tray icon
</I>&gt;<i> problems is really appreciated!
