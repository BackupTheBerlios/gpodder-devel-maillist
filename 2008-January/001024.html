<PRE>Hello, Lofton!

If possible, please send the Feed URLs of the podcast channels that 
don't work for you. Maybe one of the channels needs &quot;special treatment&quot;, 
is buggy or makes some silent bug in gPodder come up.

After that, please try as you suggested above. Also, you might want to 
start gPodder directly from the SVN version, see this URL for 
instructions on how to get gPodder SVN running:

    <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/running-from-svn">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/running-from-svn</A>

The &quot;running from svn&quot; method does not need gPodder to be installed, it 
will be run directly from the SVN checkout directory. Of course, this 
means that you have to install the packages that provide the Subversion 
client (in Debian and Ubuntu, that's &quot;subversion&quot;).

Good luck!
Thomas
