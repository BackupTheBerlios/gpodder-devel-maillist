Sounds good. If you have the time and interest, I'd love to see a 
Bugzilla installation that we can use as temporary bug tracker to see if 
it's what we need and stick with it if it is what we need :)

&gt;<i> I would think that registration would be essential for a public facing

</I>&gt;<i> register and will be advised of it's progress automatically.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to register then I can't help to think that it could get

</I>&gt;<i> edit the gPodder wiki for the same reason!
</I>
My desire to make editing the wiki as easy as possible, so potential 
contributors would not be turned away by the fact that one has to 
register, check mail, activate account, login before they can contribute.

&gt;<i> Whichever system we go for, I am more than happy to host it if my
</I>&gt;<i> webhost company supports it! (I am sure it does).   Perhaps we should
</I>&gt;<i> register gPodder.org?
</I>
Can you install a standard Bugzilla and give us the link for us to try 
out? About registering gpodder.org: I have not yet done that as I 
thought the gpodder.berlios.de address is okay and because the berlios 
subdomain is free, where the .org domain costs money.


Thanks,
Thomas
