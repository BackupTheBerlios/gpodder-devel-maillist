<PRE>Hello, Jerome, Shane and Paul!

</I>
Ok, so I think we can add to the list of needed changes:

  * Only show &quot;New episodes are available&quot; once for a set of episodes
  * Remove all the buttons on the notification bubbles


&gt;<i> However, a feature I really, really need is  the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> automaticaly download episodes as soon as they are discovered (I
</I>&gt;<i> explain it a few paragraph later).
</I>
As Paul and Shane also suggested that they would find this feature
useful, I think we should add the option, but maybe seperate to the
current option (rename the current to &quot;[...] after manual feed updates&quot;
and add a new &quot;download new episodes in the background when gPodder is
minimized&quot;). Of course, this means that we have to make sure that
automatic downloads never bring the gPodder window in the foreground,
but always run automatically (errors can still be reported via a
notification bubble).

On the other hand, who would manually update the feed cache and then not
be asked about new episodes? So maybe we should remove the option to ask
for downloading after feed updates and simply make it the default. Then
we get:

  * Remove the current automatic download option (default behaviour)
  * Add option to download new episodes in the background (minimized)
  * Make sure automatic downloads never show the gPodder window


&gt;<i> To let you understand my motivation, let me explain &quot;my ideal&quot; gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> as it tends to become (if you have to few time, you can skip it ;)):
</I>
Thanks for sharing your gPodder workflow, it's interesting to read how
other people use gPodder. We should probably make a contest in some
weeks for people to send in their usage patterns of gPodder - maybe we
can get some hints on what could be improved and maybe we can also use
this information for writing a &quot;How to best use gPodder for [...]&quot;
guide. I'll note that, maybe we can do this when we have the time.

Please have a look at the &quot;*&quot; items that I have tried to sum up in this
mail and see if this is what you think is a good thing to do. We should
probably have some more discussion before we start implementing the
planned changes.

Thanks for your time and attention to detail. I think with the results
of this discussion and a good implementation, we can make your tray icon
feature really shine and have a great release in February with the tray
icon included.

Thomas
