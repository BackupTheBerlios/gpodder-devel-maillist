<PRE>Hello!

As you hopefully know already, the Wiki's TODO list is moving to our
Bugzilla installation, and it needs some clean-up. I've weeded out some
feature requests, created a &quot;features that won't be implemented&quot; list
and also created a &quot;waiting for answer from requester&quot; list that
contains items where I'm still not sure what to do.

Won't be implemented: <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/no-features">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/no-features</A>
Waiting for requester: <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/waiting-features">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/waiting-features</A>
What's left currently: <A HREF="http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo">http://gpodderwiki.jottit.com/todo</A>

Something I want to say about the two remaining items:

-&gt; Per-channel preferences
I really think we should do this. Just have to have a look how that
could be implemented. The best way would probably to leave the global
setting in place (as default) and have the option of &quot;use default&quot; or
&quot;use custom: [...]&quot; in the channel config dialog.

I'm not yet sure if we really need the &quot;automatic locking after
download&quot; feature. What do you think?


-&gt; M3U generation
This one was really a hot topic in the last few weeks, so I think we
should get some ideas on what people want to do with this. Please post
your M3U use cases. Some things that come to my mind:

 - M3U for an MP3 player on sync
 - M3U on the PC for mplayer/mpd (see the Bugzilla bug)
 - M3U on a daily basis (what's been downloaded today?)
 - M3U per channel (all downloaded episodes in channel X)
 - M3U per group (select group on a per-channel basis?)

I also need your input here. Please discuss :)


For the list of features that won't be implemented: This list is not set
in stone, so if you are really motivated to bring some of these features
forward, you have to make a good use case and present a possible
solution on the mailing list. You should also be prepared to do the hard
work in getting the feature to work.



Thanks,
Thomas
