</I>I will get into it over the next week or so.  I have to go on a business
trip tomorrow for a few days so my weekend is very short this week!

&gt;<i> &gt; I don't mind helping with the TODO list etc.  Should we even consider a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bug/Feature reporting system such as Bugzilla?  This may help us assign
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bugs/features to various developers?   Just a thought?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I was considering a bug tracker, but quickly realized that all bug 
</I>&gt;<i> trackers that were usable (Bugzilla, Mantis, ..) required users to 
</I>&gt;<i> register. If possible, I want to make reporting bugs as easy as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Having to register an account before filing a bug is not &quot;as 
</I>&gt;<i> easy as feasible&quot;. If we decide to introduce a bug tracker, I'm thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> about Launchpad.net or Bugzilla. Any suggestions/experience with either 
</I>&gt;<i> of them, or even suggestions for other bug trackers?
</I>I have recently implemented Bugzilla at work so I am rapidly becoming an
expert with it.  We have various products that have PC based software as
well as embedded software so it is proving really useful to prioritise
the software effort with respect to critical bugs etc.  Prior to
Bugzilla bugs/features were tracked in a spreadsheet that ended up
difficult to manage.  It is only used internally (i.e it's not available
for the public to view) and it works extremely well end customers report
problems via our Customer Service department who then end up filing bugs
if they are real bugs.  

I would think that registration would be essential for a public facing
Bugzilla site, if somebody really wants to report a bug they will
register and will be advised of it's progress automatically.  If you
don't have to register then I can't help to think that it could get
abused....on that subject I am surprised registration is not required to
edit the gPodder wiki for the same reason!

Whichever system we go for, I am more than happy to host it if my
webhost company supports it! (I am sure it does).   Perhaps we should
register gPodder.org?

Paul
