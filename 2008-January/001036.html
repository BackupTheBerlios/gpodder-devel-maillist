You did the cake, I just put the cherries on it - you deserve credit for 
this feature. I will keep the patch around in my working copy and I 
might send one or two more updates to this mailing list as I find bugs, 
but apart from that, the patch is mostly done.

As the next gPodder release will probably go into the LTS version of 
Ubuntu (8.04), which means that many users will have this version as the 
default from their distribution, I want to make the next release very 
stable, so I'm thinking of postponing the integration of the tray icon 
patch until after the next release, which might lead to an release in 
mid-January (instead of late January).

What do you think about doing a stable release in a few days and then 
merging the tray icon patch soon after, so we have another month until 
the following release (in Feburary) to stabilize this feature?

Thanks,
Thomas
