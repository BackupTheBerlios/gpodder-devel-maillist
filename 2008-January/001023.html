<PRE>Hi Thomas,
Sorry, but it's not doing it. Before I run through the remove and
reinstall routine I thought I'd just double-check with you.

I removed both the 0.9.5 through the uninstaller in the package (make
uninstall) and the 0.10.1 through the synaptic &quot;complete removal&quot; tool,
then trashed the ~/.config.gpodder file and double checked
the /usr/local files for anything lurking there, there appeared to be
nothing. 

Then, since I had synaptic running, i reinstalled 0.10.1 from synaptic.
This is the only deviation from your instructions, but it should not
have been a problem I thought. I had the .deb package on my desktop, and
still do, so I could re- from there without trouble still of course.

Finally, i started up and loaded your .opml from Berlios with the
starter podcast subscriptions. Everything was fine up to there and
gpodder recognized teh downloads from the previous install and informed
as much.

Then I started to add my other feeds, about 16 or 18 of them. 

This is where the unhappiness started. The first two or three loaded
without trouble,but then nothing else would add. This is to say it
accepted them, if they were ones I already had downloads for then it
would tell me that the downloads were current, if it was new then it
would offer to download the new episode, but nothing new would appear in
the channel pane even though the list in the episode pane would be
populated and marked for download.

It was bedtime so I closed it and went to bed. This morning I started it
again and it opens, freezes and has to be forced to close. There is
nothing in either pane, none of the controls respond at all. 

So....I am ready to reinstall with my Dled version after another
removal, but await your suggestions first.

Thanks
