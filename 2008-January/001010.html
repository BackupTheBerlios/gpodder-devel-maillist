<PRE>Hello, gPodder users and developers!

First of all, I wish you all a happy new year 2008. This mail is about 
maybe switching from SVN to Git and about the areas of gPodder in which 
YOUR help is needed :) The first section is about SVN/Git, the second is 
about the help-needing parts - please read at least the second one if 
time permits.

-----

In the last few weeks, we've seen some people on the mailing list start 
providing patches to gPodder that fulfill long-standing feature 
requests. I believe this is partially to the introduction of the wiki, 
which enables us to easily update the project status.

I'm very happy with the tray icon patch that is currently in the works, 
J&#233;r&#244;me Chabod does a great job getting this patch forward.

Some months ago, I started using Git for some projects of mine, and it 
really shines in some aspects compared to Subversion. I would like your 
input and opinion about switching gPodder development from Subversion to 
Git for some reasons:

  * Easier branching (would be better for &quot;big&quot; patches like trayicon)
  * Multiple developers (work on your patch, publish the Git repository)
  * Offline development (commits don't need an online connection)
  * No server outages (BerliOS' SVN server is unavailable at times)

What do you think? Should we &quot;go Git&quot;?

------

Another area in which I need some help is maintaining gPodder, answering 
questions on the mailing list, maintaining/cleaning up the TODO list, 
taking care of the Wiki in general and reviewing/applying patches. There 
are some persons on the mailing list that have been involved 
in/following the gPodder project for some months now. I wonder if you 
want to join in and be more officially involved in gPodder by taking 
over some small areas of responsibility, like:

  * Taking care of the Wiki (clean-up, user documentation)
  * Answering questions on the mailing list (and updating the FAQ)
  * Review patches and/or manage the TODO list (specifications)
  * Co-maintainership (code-wise)

For the Co-maintainership, I want to add some remarks: First, the code 
style I used to write until two months ago was not adhering to PEP-8[1], 
which is the style guideline for Python. I've started writing code with 
PEP-8 in mind now, but am only updating the sections of the codebase 
that are changed for a commit. If you write Python code for gPodder, 
please take the three minutes required to read PEP-8. I will try to 
reformat your patches when needed, but reviewing and merging your patch 
will be faster when I don't need to reformat every line :)

Also, for the GTK+ GUI and preferences, please keep it as simple as 
possible. I initially suggested to add six different options for the 
tray icon and notification area, but now I think this is overkill and 
not &quot;usable&quot;. As far as the GUI design goes, we should keep the GNOME 
HIG[2] in mind where possible.

Apart from that, there's not much to say about writing &quot;good&quot; code for 
gPodder. I would be really happy if at least one or two would step up 
and help improve gPodder.

Looking at our TODO list, there is not much that is left to do to bring 
the codebase and the GUI in good shape for a 1.0 release. Maybe we 
should draft a 1.0 roadmap - that would also be a good opportunity to 
get involved in the gPodder team :)

Thanks for taking the time to read this (rather long) mail :)

Thomas
