<PRE>Hi Thomas

First of all, Happy New Year to you and your family.

SVN vs Git - I do not have any experience of Git, but the benefits you
highlight seem to suit the distributed development model.  I'll be
interested in what others have to say, in the meantime I will do some
reading up on Git and perhaps set it up on my server so that I can
experiment with it!

I am more than willing to help out in any of the areas you have
highlighted. I am not as experienced as some of the others in the list
developing in Python / GTK / Linux so maybe I am not best suited as a
co-maintainer, however I am still learning and am willing to give it a
try if nobody else steps forward!

I have started on some documentation (locally) however with the dynamics
of some of the features right now I may stick with a version just to get
a baseline up on the Wiki.  

I don't mind helping with the TODO list etc.  Should we even consider a
Bug/Feature reporting system such as Bugzilla?  This may help us assign
bugs/features to various developers?   Just a thought?

Paul

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the last few weeks, we've seen some people on the mailing list start 
</I>&gt;<i> providing patches to gPodder that fulfill long-standing feature 
</I>&gt;<i> requests. I believe this is partially to the introduction of the wiki, 
</I>&gt;<i> which enables us to easily update the project status.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm very happy with the tray icon patch that is currently in the works, 
</I>&gt;<i> J&#233;r&#244;me Chabod does a great job getting this patch forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some months ago, I started using Git for some projects of mine, and it 
</I>&gt;<i> really shines in some aspects compared to Subversion. I would like your 
</I>&gt;<i> input and opinion about switching gPodder development from Subversion to 
</I>&gt;<i> Git for some reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Easier branching (would be better for &quot;big&quot; patches like trayicon)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Multiple developers (work on your patch, publish the Git repository)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Offline development (commits don't need an onlIf this is the general consensus then go for it...I must now read up on Git and give it a try on my home server! ine connection)
</I>&gt;<i>   * No server outages (BerliOS' SVN server is unavailable at times)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? Should we &quot;go Git&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another area in which I need some help is maintaining gPodder, answering 
</I>&gt;<i> questions on the mailing list, maintaining/cleaning up the TODO list, 
</I>&gt;<i> taking care of the Wiki in general and reviewing/applying patches. There 
</I>&gt;<i> are some persons on the mailing list that have been involved 
</I>&gt;<i> in/following the gPodder project for some months now. I wonder if you 
</I>&gt;<i> want to join in and be more officially involved in gPodder by taking 
</I>&gt;<i> over some small areas of responsibility, like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Taking care of the Wiki (clean-up, user documentation)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Answering questions on 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Review patches and/or manage the TODO list (specifications)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Co-maintainership (code-wise)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the Co-maintainership, I want to add some remarks: First, the code 
</I>&gt;<i> style I used to write until two months ago was not adhering to PEP-8[1], 
</I>&gt;<i> which is the style guideline for Python. I've started writing code with 
</I>&gt;<i> PEP-8 in mind now, but am only updating the sections of the codebase 
</I>&gt;<i> that are changed for a commit. If you write Python code for gPodder, 
</I>&gt;<i> please take the three minutes required to read PEP-8. I will try to 
</I>&gt;<i> reformat your patches when needed, but reviewing and merging your patch 
</I>&gt;<i> will be faster when I don't need to reformat every line :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, for the GTK+ GUI and preferences, please keep it as simple as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. I initially suggested to add six different options for the 
</I>&gt;<i> tray icon and notification area, but now I think this is overkill and 
</I>&gt;<i> not &quot;usable&quot;. As far as the GUI design goes, we should keep the GNOME 
</I>&gt;<i> HIG[2] in mind where possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from that, there's not much to say about writing &quot;good&quot; code for 
</I>&gt;<i> gPodder. I would be really happy if at least one or two would step up 
</I>&gt;<i> and help improve gPodder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at our TODO list, there is not much that is left to do to bring 
</I>&gt;<i> the codebase and the GUI in good shape for a 1.0 release. Maybe we 
</I>&gt;<i> should draft a 1.0 roadmap - that would also be a good opportunity to 
</I>&gt;<i> get involved in the gPodder team :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for taking the time to read this (rather long) mail :)
