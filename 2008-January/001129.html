<PRE>Hello, Kaity!

Please try not to write answers to all discissions to a single answer
e-mail in one thread, but try to send follow-up e-mails with content
that belongs to a specific discussion thread to the last mail in this
thread. For a new discussion, never reply but open a new mail.

This way, reading and sorting e-mail is much easier. Thanks :)

Closed/resolved state is not handled in the priority field, but in
another special field that already works well.

I've just commited the code before reading your mail, I've also sent a
mail to gpodder-devel, so you should have gotten it, too. It will be
included in the next release of gPodder in February, together with the
tray icon and notification support.

A temporary M3U generation solution would be nice. This way, we could
also experiment how MP3 players support relative or absolute paths on
the MP3 player (i.e. which path separators it accepts, how we should add
absolute paths if relative paths are not supported, etc..).


&gt;<i> Lastly, Thomas will you be adding command line support for

</I>
CLI sync support comes with the new sync module that is in SVN right now
- this means that &quot;gpodder --sync&quot; does the same thing as when you click
the corresponding menu item in the GUI. Feedback about the sync process
is also provided on the console in CLI mode.
