<PRE>Hello there,

I have been using gPodder for the last few weeks and I have to say: what a
great application!

But I think that right now there is some room for improvement on GUI side of
the application.
I've made a mockup of how I think the GUI should look like (there is nothing
radical, just some few changes):

<A HREF="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/7514/gpoddermockuptn7.png">http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/7514/gpoddermockuptn7.png</A>
<A HREF="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/3065/gpoddermockupinfobu8.png">http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/3065/gpoddermockupinfobu8.png</A>

I think this would enable a much simpler GUI, more clean and intuitive.
For example:

* I don't like the toolbar, so I would rather prefer an option to hide it
(View &gt; Toolbar).
* Also, there is no need of an exclusive tab just to show the download
progress-- it can be shown in the same main window.
* The short description of the episode would be shown in the bottom when the
item is selected.
* The &quot;Info&quot; togglebutton would show/hide the information about the episode
(including the full description and other pieces of information).

I think the other changes speak by themselves.

I've implemented part of these changes to myself, but I think that maybe
someone else would appreciate that. But at the very least, the show/hide
toolbar should be available, if someone want to I could send a patch for
that, as well help with the implementation of the other things.

So, what do you guys think about that?

Regards.
