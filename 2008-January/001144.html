&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been using gPodder for a few weeks now and it is definitely the best
</I>&gt;<i> podcast client I've used on Linux, but that's not to say the software is
</I>&gt;<i> without flaws.  The biggest thing about gPodder that I would like to see
</I>&gt;<i> improved is the modal feed checking, file downloading, and file transfers to
</I>&gt;<i> an MP3 player.  I don't see a technical reason why the application can't
</I>&gt;<i> transfer an episode to my MP3 player while I click around to find other
</I>&gt;<i> episodes to transfer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To solve this, I propose changing the downloads tab to an actions tab that
</I>&gt;<i> would list pending actions and their state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much like the downloads are handled now, I would add options to select how
</I>&gt;<i> many concurrent transfers are allowed and how many concurrent feed updates
</I>&gt;<i> are allowed.  Possibly, a &quot;total concurrent actions&quot; option could be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see this as a huge benefit as it allows:
</I>&gt;<i> - Users with fast Internet connections to update multiple feeds at once.
</I>&gt;<i> - Users would be able to pick one file to transfer to an MP3 player and have
</I>&gt;<i> it transfer while browsing around for another file to transfer.
</I>&gt;<i> - Reduce &quot;task bar clutter.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only drawback I can see is the additional coding required, however I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it is too intensive.  When the user requests a feed update, it
</I>&gt;<i> will add itself to the queue and start executing if the max. concurrent feed
</I>&gt;<i> updates has not been reached.  When a feed update completes, it another feed
</I>&gt;<i> update so long as there is one to update.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, threads will probably have to be used if they are not already.
</I>&gt;<i> Because gPodder is not cross-platform, I don't think this will be too much
</I>&gt;<i> of a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, finally, if I wrote up the code that implemented the above suggestion,
</I>&gt;<i> would it get merged into the gPodder trunk?  Or is there a reason that this
</I>&gt;<i> was not done already?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Dan Finnie

What about an option to only sync &quot;selected&quot; episodes? You could
select everything that you want to sync through a right click option
(or a checkbox column) then transfer them in one big batch like it's
done now.

I think you're idea is pretty cool but it might be hard to implement.
In the meantime you could use the &quot;only sync unplayed episodes&quot; option
to do something similar, albeit in a much hackier way. Just mark all
the episodes as played, then mark the ones you want to sync as
unplayed and sync away! You should also enable the &quot;Mark episode as
played after synchronization&quot; option.
