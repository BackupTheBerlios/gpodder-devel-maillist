<PRE>Hello!

As Jerome suggested today, I've branched the current stable trunk for 
the 0.10.4 release, which should be out in mid-to-late January and 
finally fixed up the last bits of code that I wanted to change in the 
Tray icon patch that has been done by Jerome (with some suggestions by 
the mailing list members and building upon the automatic feed update 
feature by Nick). The tray icon patch is now in our SVN trunk and ready 
for our testing.

If possible, please also test the release branch of gPodder (0.10.4), 
which can be done by replacing the &quot;trunk&quot; in the checkout URL with 
&quot;branches/gpodder-0.10.4&quot;. This will check out the source code as it was 
just before commiting the tray icon patch. Nothing except bugfixes will 
be added to this branch. The branch will die with the release of 0.10.4.

The next step after the tray icon patch is my updated synchronization 
code, which should hopefully fix some annoyances and bring features such 
as CLI synchronization to gPodder. Of course, all other patches that 
come in by mail now can be applied, as the current trunk will not be 
released until mid-to-late February, which gives us some time to test 
and stabilize the codebase.


Thanks,
Thomas
