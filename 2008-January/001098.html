<PRE>Hello!

I've just released gPodder 0.10.4. You can grab the tarball from the
project website now or wait until it gets packaged in your distribution.

Thanks to all of you who contributed to this new release of gPodder!

Release notes: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/news.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/news.html</A>
Download: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/downloads.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/downloads.html</A>

The release notes follow...

----------------------
After the early December release, we had enough time to prepare this
special release: gPodder 0.10.4 is here, and it shines with its updated
translations, some minor feature enhancements and many bug fixes that
make this release a very stable one. Of course, this also means that we
have not included all the cool features that you can already find in our
Subversion repository, but it means you get a stable, usable podcast
downloader. The new features currently in development will be stabilized
until late February for the next release.

In this release cycle, not only did we enhance the gPodder Wiki and had
fun trying to get the iPod Touch working (thanks to Pieter De Decker),
we also got a brand new, Bugzilla-based bug tracker that we plan to use
for keeping track of bug reports and feature requests - thanks to Paul
Rudkin for taking the time to set everything up and for hosting the
Bugzilla installation. I am also very grateful for the two books I got
sent via my Amazon Wishlist - it is a nice motivation for doing some
more work on gPodder. Last but not least, I want to thank all the people
that have contributed to this release, they are listed below (and I hope
I didn't forget anybody).

You can grab the new release tarball from the downloads page or wait
until the new version makes it into your distribution's package
repositories. If you have any questions or problems, please see our
FAQs, our Wiki or the Mailing list. Thanks.
