<PRE>Hello, Paul!

Thanks for your feedback regarding my questions. I hope that we also get 
some other people to respond to get an overview of the options we have.

It would be great if you could slowly start to migrate that 
documentation to the Wiki. It doesn't matter if it is &quot;done&quot; or not 
(documentation will never fully be &quot;done&quot;), so just push it on the wiki, 
link it from the start page (maybe even create a &quot;User guide&quot; page that 
links the single documentation pages together from one place. It's a 
wiki and its history is fully saved, so you can't really do anything 
wrong - and if, it's quickly reverted, anyway :)

&gt;<i> I don't mind helping with the TODO list etc.  Should we even consider a
</I>&gt;<i> Bug/Feature reporting system such as Bugzilla?  This may help us assign
</I>&gt;<i> bugs/features to various developers?   Just a thought?
</I>
Yes, I was considering a bug tracker, but quickly realized that all bug 
trackers that were usable (Bugzilla, Mantis, ..) required users to 
register. If possible, I want to make reporting bugs as easy as 
possible. Having to register an account before filing a bug is not &quot;as 
easy as feasible&quot;. If we decide to introduce a bug tracker, I'm thinking 
about Launchpad.net or Bugzilla. Any suggestions/experience with either 
of them, or even suggestions for other bug trackers?

Thanks,
Thomas
