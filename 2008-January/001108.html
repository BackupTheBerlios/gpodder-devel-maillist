I think all these special cases make configuring and using gPodder
harder than it should be. I agree with you on the problems with gPodder
popping up randomly.

The purpose of &quot;auto-download new episodes&quot; is that a user that wants to
download new episodes doesn't have to click on &quot;download new episodes&quot;
after clicking &quot;refresh feeds&quot;, so the menu item would better be
described as &quot;auto-download new episodes after a manual feed update&quot;,
which would already tell us the way to go. In my opinion, when gPodder
is minimized to the tray icon, it should only tell the user that new
episodes are available or that downloads have been finished. Although
the buttons in the notification bubble are nice, I think they are a bad
idea for interacting the way we use it currently. The buttons in the
notification area are more useful for things like &quot;don't show me this
again&quot; or in case of an error &quot;show the logfile&quot; or such things.

Interaction with gPodder should only happen when it is not minimized. If
you are letting yourself be distracted by the notification bubble (and
try to read and click on it), you might as well only get a notification
and if you want to act upon it, open gPodder and carry out the actions
you want to do.

The timeout in the notification bubbles with action buttons also gives a
&quot;hurry, hurry - you have to do something now!&quot; kind of feeling - same
with instant messengers - that surely interrupt the normal workflow.

In my opinion, we should throw out the action buttons completely and
make gPodder behave nice and non-intrusive when minimized. This means:
only notification bubbles for the following scenarios:

 * New episodes are available
 * Downloads have been finished
 (did I forget something here?)

Also, the &quot;new episodes are available&quot; notification should only be shown
once, not every time the feed cache gets updated.

When gPodder is minimized, updating the feed cache (automatically or
manually) should never trigger an automatic download. The option
mentioned above should only come into effect when the feed update was
initiated manually and gPodder was not minimized.

What do you think? Anybody willing to implement it this way? I still
want to do the new sync code, so any help with fixing the tray icon
problems is really appreciated!

Thomas
