This sounds pretty perfect. My main concern is having gpodder do things
by itself when minimized and I think you realise that. Notifications are
still good, but only if they don't make you do anything, but just notify
you.

Thanks Thomas.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand your point of view and I must honestly say I also won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need all this extra &quot;buttons&quot;. I also agree to the fact that &quot;new

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so I think we can add to the list of needed changes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Only show &quot;New episodes are available&quot; once for a set of episodes
</I>&gt;<i>   * Remove all the buttons on the notification bubbles
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, a feature I really, really need is  the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automaticaly download episodes as soon as they are discovered (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explain it a few paragraph later).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As Paul and Shane also suggested that they would find this feature
</I>&gt;<i> useful, I think we should add the option, but maybe seperate to the
</I>&gt;<i> current option (rename the current to &quot;[...] after manual feed updates&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and add a new &quot;download new episodes in the background when gPodder is
</I>&gt;<i> minimized&quot;). Of course, this means that we have to make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> automatic downloads never bring the gPodder window in the foreground,
</I>&gt;<i> but always run automatically (errors can still be reported via a
</I>&gt;<i> notification bubble).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, who would manually update the feed cache and then not
</I>&gt;<i> be asked about new episodes? So maybe we should remove the option to ask
</I>&gt;<i> for downloading after feed updates and simply make it the default. Then
</I>&gt;<i> we get:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Remove the current automatic download option (default behaviour)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Add option to download new episodes in the background (minimized)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Make sure automatic downloads never show the gPodder window
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To let you understand my motivation, let me explain &quot;my ideal&quot; gPodder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as it tends to become (if you have to few time, you can skip it ;)):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing your gPodder workflow, it's interesting to read how
</I>&gt;<i> other people use gPodder. We should probably make a contest in some
</I>&gt;<i> weeks for people to send in their usage patterns of gPodder - maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> can get some hints on what could be improved and maybe we can also use
</I>&gt;<i> this information for writing a &quot;How to best use gPodder for [...]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> guide. I'll note that, maybe we can do this when we have the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please have a look at the &quot;*&quot; items that I have tried to sum up in this
</I>&gt;<i> mail and see if this is what you think is a good thing to do. We should
</I>&gt;<i> probably have some more discussion before we start implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> planned changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your time and attention to detail. I think with the results
</I>&gt;<i> of this discussion and a good implementation, we can make your tray icon
</I>&gt;<i> feature really shine and have a great release in February with the tray
</I>&gt;<i> icon included.
