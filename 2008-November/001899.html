<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I would really like to see gpodder be a able to filter the downloaded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; files when exporting.  It's frustrating to transfer a file to my Archos only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to find out later that it's at a resolution or format that I can't play. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a could filter by type then shuffle it off to another directory and to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; necessary transcoding.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps transcoding when copying to the MP3 device is what you're looking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for.  This is an interest of mine also.  Although I've not laid out a design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (or put an entry in the bug database), I've thought this should be tied to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the MP3 device type so gPodder would know what file formats are supported by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; your device and which need to be transcoded.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry about the long delay in response. However transcode isn't exactly what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want. I have an Archos 605 and I would like to filter video files into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory &quot;/media/A605/Video&quot; instead of &quot;/media/A605/Podcasts&quot; which is my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default. I currently run a script to handle it after the fact but I'd like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to see something like with an email client. Filter what to do with a file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on a parameter such as file type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to put too much functionality into gPodder that should be
</I>&gt;<i> placed elsewhere, but I can understand your need for this feature due to the
</I>&gt;<i> way your portable player works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would a configure post-synchronization script help? I.e. you enter the
</I>&gt;<i> name of your script, the script gets some info via environment variables and
</I>&gt;<i> carries out whatever action you want? (i.e. move files around)
</I>
Just a quick comment on this - My Cowan D2 also has Video in a separate folder
from Audio, and I think the functionality belongs in gPodder.  I can see
transcoding being a post download script that the user is resposible for, but
file placement on the device I think belongs to gPodder.
