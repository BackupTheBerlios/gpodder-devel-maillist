<PRE>Hello, Jeff!

I haven't checked the optional dependencies, but some of them are just
called with popen/subprocess/os.system, so I suppose the licenses don't
have to be compatible, as it's not considered linking(??).

I have yet to check the license of the dependencies (python-xml,
python-feedparser), but I suppose these are compatible. It would be very
helpful if you could check the licenses of the dependencies and report
back if you find any problems, the dependencies are listed here:

<A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/dependencies.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/dependencies.html</A>

&gt;<i> If there are any codebases which are licensed under the GPLv2 without
</I>&gt;<i> the option of using a later version then you have a compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> issue which could end up biting anyone who wants to distribute this. 
</I>
Here's what I've checked about the code that is _directly_ used in the
gPodder codebase and therefore currently distributed with gPodder:

The SimpleGladeApp.py file (which is used by gPodder &quot;directly&quot;) is
Copyright 2004 Sandino Flores Moreno, and licensed under &quot;LGPL 2.1 or
later&quot;, which should be compatible with GPLv3 and if not can be upgraded
to LGPLv3 (as it's &quot;or later&quot;, right?).

The cache.py file (which is used by SVN gPodder) is Copyright 2007 Doug
Hellman which looks like a BSD-style license without advertising clause,
therefore being (to my knowledge) GPL-compatible, the exact license text
follows here:

=====================
# Copyright 2007 Doug Hellmann.

# NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
# CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
=====================

All other things are implemented either by me or as a patch to the
&quot;GPLv2 or later&quot; gPodder source, which makes all patches and
contributions &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, so this can be upgraded to GPLv3, or did
I miss something here?

Of course, IANAL, so any help and corrections are welcome :)


Thanks,
Thomas
