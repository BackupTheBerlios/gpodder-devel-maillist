<PRE>Hello!

I won't go posting about every little change now, but as we're
approaching a new release soon and as there is a cool new feature (cover
editor), I want to inform you that these new features are available :)

First of all, the combobox (comboAvailable) finally got removed, as I
mentioned in an earlier mail. The problems you have raised have mostly
been dealt with (channel navigator is not hideable anymore, channel
navigator's scroll position is restored when it reads a new treemodel).

Drag'n'drop of feed URLs to the gPodder main window has been supported
for a long time already, I've just modified a bit so that the user has
to drop the feed URL onto the channel navigator instead of dropping it
somewhere in the main window.

Now on to the cool feature..

I've improved the handling of channel cover files! :) The channel editor
will not download the cover automatically, but you can download the
corresponding cover by clicking the &quot;download&quot; button in the cover
editor. The cover editor now also allows you to delete the cover (in
case you don't like it anymore). The coolest feature comes now: You can
drag'n'drop a cover of your choice onto the cover editor and the cover
editor will use the dragged image as the cover of the channel. This
comes in handy when the channel doesn't provide an image or the image is
just ugly. Here's a screenshot on how the cover editor looks now:
