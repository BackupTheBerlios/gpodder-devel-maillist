I think the problem is related to gPodder doing status updates more
often than previously, and the GTK interface has to keep up with the
constant flow of GUI updates (window title and the &quot;downloads&quot; tree
model + tree view).

I've tried porting gPodder to Windows yesterday, and running on my
1.7GHz Pentium IV-M, I was able to see these &quot;hanging&quot; problems on Win32
when downloading from a local server. It doesn't happen to me on Linux
(I'm having my download queue set to 1) and if doesn't happen when
downloading _anything_ from the Internet, because with my previous 64k
line, I can't get anything beyond 8kb/s, so there cannot possibly be
more GUI updates than that :)

That being said, I think I could try to limit the number of GUI updates
by filtering the messages sent to the GUI for updating the interface. I
would need you to check out the SVN repository, apply patches to it that
I send you and you test if things work with a high-speed internet
connection. Would you like to help here?

Thomas
