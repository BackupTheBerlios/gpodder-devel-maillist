<PRE>2007-09-21: gPodder 0.10.0 &quot;Hier spricht Frank Drebin&quot; released

Web Announcement: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/news.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/news.html</A>
Downloads: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/downloads.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/downloads.html</A>
Screenshots: <A HREF="http://gpodder.berlios.de/screenshots.html">http://gpodder.berlios.de/screenshots.html</A> 

After one month of hard work, I'm very proud to announce the greatest
release of gPodder so far: gPodder 0.10.0 is here :) We have been busy
preparing the new release, which is a huge step forward compared to the 
previous releases. Highlights of this release include the support for
all RSS dialects and Atom feeds by utilizing the Universal Feedparser.
The download system was also updated to use urllib, so we don't depend
on wget anymore and downloads should appear smoother in the GUI now.

If you are tracking our codebase, you will notice that there has been a
big wave of re-structuring and re-organization in the last few weeks.
This makes the gPodder codebase more maintainable and also makes adding
features easier. For example, we now have a live download status in
episode info dialogs. Context (&quot;right-click&quot;) menus were also added to
the available episodes view and the channel navigator. The GUI has once
more been slipstreamed - have a look at the new screenshots!

Well, really - there has been a lot going on in the last few weeks, so I
am very happy to present you this new version now. Grab it, install it
and tell us how you like it, the gpodder-devel mailing list is always
waiting to hear about your experience with gPodder. If you like gPodder
and want to show your appreciation, please have a look at my wishlist.
As with every release, donations are always welcome. You are still
reading the release notes? Download gPodder 0.10.0 now!


Dependencies
      * Added: python-feedparser (adds support for Atom and all RSS
        &quot;dialects&quot;)
      * Removed: wget (we're using our own download library based on
        urllib now)
      * Removed: python-xml (we're now using xml.dom.minidom from the
        Python standard library)
      * Removed: tepache (not needed, I've even improved SimpleGladeApp
        to be easier to use)

Features
      * New feed caching code, based on Doug Hellmann's feedcache
      * Channel settings are now saved in a shelve-based database
        (faster, more reliable)
      * Using DOM for processing XML where SAX has been used previously
      * Default format for gPodder's channel list is now OPML :)
      * TreeModel caching for the available episodes list makes the GUI
        more responsive
      * Re-structured internal module names in the gpodder package
      * Reworked DownloadStatusManager to be more reliable (in
        gpodder.service module)
      * Merge status/played column into one &quot;status&quot; column in available
        episodes view
      * Support for videos with .divx extension (thanks to Alistair
        Sutton)
      * Episode dialog now shows live download progress (very helpful
        for tracking download status)
      * Removed obsolete documentation from source distribution
      * Context menu for available episodes list and channel list
        (possible actions)
      * Make it possible to cancel downloads directly in the available
        episodes view
      * Warn user when she hasn't got python-feedparser installed (hard
        dependency now)
      * Use Python's webbrowser module to open URLs (works even without
        gnome-open installed)
      * Intelligent enclosure chooser algorithm when there are multiple
        enclosures
      * Support for customized file names in MP3 player sync code
      * Mark episodes as downloaded/deleted when deleting episodes (as
        suggested by Holger Leskien)
      * New DOM-based LocalDB writer/reader (more reliable, faster and
        even cooler!)
      * Offline support for feedcache, faster startup (threaded .desktop
        file loading)
      * gPodder now sends a correct User-Agent when downloading feeds,
        OPML files and episodes
      * Replaced libwget with new, urllib-based download module (faster
        GUI updates, more reliable transfers)
      * Center feed update dialog on main window
      * Reset scroll position to previous position when refreshing the
        channel list (thanks to Alistair Sutton for reporting)
      * New channel cover editor: Supports dragging images into the
        cover window to set custom cover, etc..
      * Usability: Center the episode info dialog on the available
        episodes list (less mouse movements)
      * Improved drag'n'drop support for dragging feed URLs to the
        channel navigator
      * Removed channel combobox and made the channel navigator
        unhideable, removed channel button

Bugfixes
      * Fix episode metadata for really buggy feeds (thanks to )
      * Utilize feedparser's date parsing to fix some bugs with strange
        pubDate formats
      * Fix a bug when traversing directories with loop symlinks
        (reported by Bj&#248;rn Rasmussen)
      * Lots of old bugs fixed by replacing SAX with DOM, by adding
        feedparser and new downloader
