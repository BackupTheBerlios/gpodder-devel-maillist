Probably not. The GUI interface is more responsive and accurate with
reporting progress, with wget that wasn't possible.

It's much cleaner in implementation than the old &quot;libwget&quot; stuff, so
easier maintainable. Also (as mentioned above), the status and progress
updates are more accurate and the progress bar updates more often.

urllib as it's currently used doesn't support resume, but the old
&quot;libwget&quot; also didn't really support resume, as the partially downloaded
file was deleted after a failure. I'm still not sure how to correctly
implement download resume without cluttering the hard disk with many
partially downloaded files (currently, gPodder tries to keep its
download folders clean). Also, some HTTP web servers still don't support
resuming correctly, so this means more error checking and handling on
the client side.

So, as for resume in gPodder: Some time in the future when I get to it.
