gPodder has started out with &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, and all code
contributions are therefore upgradable to GPLv3.

As you raised the question and I was interested myself, I've checked the
copyright info for all dependencies (optional or strict) for the gPodder
Debian package (as this is what I package and use). I'm talking about
the current development version (in SVN), as 0.9.5 is still GPLv2:

python-gtk2: LGPL, version 2 or later
python-glade2: LGPL, version 2 or later
wget: GPL, version 2 or later (w/ OpenSSL exception)

Note that wget is only called using the &quot;popen2&quot; module (i.e. not
linked, but called and its output parsed by gPodder), but it would be
GPLv2 or later, anyway.

python-pymad: GPL, version 2
python-eyed3: GPL, version 2 or later

I don't know if pymad will become a problem, but if it does, simply
remove the dependency or if it's even impossible to distribute the
source this way, I can remove support for pymad, as the functionality
provided by pymad can also be provided by eyed3 or mplayer.

mplayer: GPL, version 2

But again, mplayer is only used through &quot;os.popen&quot;, and only its stdout
output gets parsed by gPodder, so IIRC this is not considered &quot;linking&quot;
and therefore is no licensing problem(???).

Some points need to be clarified, mentioned above.


Thanks,
Thomas
