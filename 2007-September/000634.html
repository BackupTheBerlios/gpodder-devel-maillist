</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attached is the new libtagupdate.py and the patch for libipodsync, I
</I>&gt;<i> hope you guys like it!
</I>
Because of the license problems, I'll currently leave this one out of
the SVN repository. Maybe you can ask mutagen's upstream if they want to
dual-license it under GPLv2 and GPLv3 or simply under &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;.
