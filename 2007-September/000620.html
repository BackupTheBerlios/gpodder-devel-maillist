<PRE>Hello!

I found a really cool python library called mutagen than can edit the metadata 
of almost any filetype! The best part is that it appends to the tags, you 
don't have to completely erase them to write new tags (this is much more 
useful than vorbiscomment).

I've re-written libtagupdate.py using mutagen and it seems to work quite well. 
As a consequence it removes the need for the vorbis-tools and eyeD3 
dependencies.

I also quickly implemented it in libipodsync.py to detect filelengths, the 
only filetype I've found so far that it can't detect is avi but that's not 
playable on the iPod anyway. I think it might also be possible to do cover 
art extraction with this tool so that would potentially eliminate the need 
for pymad and of-course, mplayer as well.

This seemed (at least to me) too good to be true and sadly it might be... The 
problem is that it's licensed under the GPLv2. I've spoken with the lead 
developer and he's not too fond of the GPLv3. Here's what he had to say:

&lt;piman&gt; You can use Mutagen in a program licensed under &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, but 
then only under the terms of GPLv2. We don't have plans to switch to GPLv3.

Attached is the new libtagupdate.py and the patch for libipodsync, I hope you 
guys like it!

P.S. mutagen is available as python-mutagen under debian, fedora and ubuntu.
