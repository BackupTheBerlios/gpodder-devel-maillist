<PRE>Hello, gPodder users and developers!

After long consideration phases, I've implemented a new downloader in
the last few days, which I have now commited into our subversion
repository after a few tests and improvements.

The new downloader removes the dependency on &quot;wget&quot; and uses Python's
&quot;urllib&quot; module, which is included in the standard distribution.

Apart from the removed dependency, this also simplifies the
download-related code in our codebase and makes progress updates more
reliable and smooth.

Just in time with the new downloading code, I've also added User-agent
support to gPodder, which means gPodder will send a User-Agent string to
webservers to identify itself as gPodder (with version), and also send a
referer string (feed URL) when downloading episodes.

Now, it's up to you to test and report back how it works for you. Tell
me what you think and test it with your podcast feeds! If everything
seems to work well, the next gPodder release should be ready in a few
days, and will be a HUGE step forward compared to the last version.


Thomas
