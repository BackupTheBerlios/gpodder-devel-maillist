Oh my, if you haven't brought this to my attention, we'd still have
this stupid bug in svn now - my fault for not being cautious when
adding a __cmp__() function to the podcastItem class. Returning zero by
default in the comparison function introduced a bug in libwget.py,
which is responsible for calling up the podcastChannel to add a
downloaded item to the localdb (which is a metadata cache for
downloaded items) and mark the file as downloaded in history.

To make a sad story short, I've just fixed the bug in svn, so all new
episodes will have their metadata correctly written again, and gPodder
behaves now like it has before Monday (when I introduced that bug) -
downloaded but already-disappeared-from-feed episodes will be appended
to the list just as if the episode was at the end of the list. If you
delete the episode from there, it will automatically disappear.

For all the episodes that you've downloaded from Monday to today, run a
&quot;svn up&quot; to get the latest gPodder trunk, then run gPodder with the new
code and play back every episode downloaded since monday. Playing back
the episode will now check if the episode is in the localdb (metadata
cache) and add it if necessary. Sorry for that bug, but hey - it's the
development version, after all :)


Enjoy,
Thomas
