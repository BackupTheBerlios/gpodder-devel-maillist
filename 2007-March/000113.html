<PRE>Hi

I have just started using gpodder to download different radio programs
that I would like to listen to on my ogg player[TM]. The problem is
that if I do a sync then all files are transferred. Usually I just want
to transfer one or two programs at a time not 600Mb worth of programs
per week. As gpodder is now I don't see how I can do this. So I thought
to patch gpodder with and option that one can choose to sync selected
files. However, as I look in the code I'm wondering if there is an easy
way to do it. What I mean is that the on_sync_to_ipod_activate function
does a lot of checks that shouldn't be duplicated? Can they be moved,
and if so where is it preferable to put the code?

Keep up the excellent work

Preben
