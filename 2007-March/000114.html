<PRE>Hello Preben,

You can exclude certain channels from the synchronization process by
selecting the channel, open the &quot;edit channel&quot; dialog, go to the
&quot;Synchronization&quot; tab and select &quot;Skip this channel when syncing to my
device&quot;. This way, gPodder will not sync this channel to your MP3
player.

&gt;<i> So I thought to patch gpodder with and option that one can choose to

</I>
The only method you would want to change is the
&quot;add_episode_from_channel&quot; function in libipodsync.py. There, check if
the episode is one you want to sync and if not, return before the
gPodderSyncMethod.add_episode_from_channel() function call.

I don't know what's the best way to solve this without much user
interaction (e.g. a &quot;Select episodes to sync&quot; dialog or checkboxes in
the gPodder main window or a checkbox in the episode info dialog).


Hope that helps,
Thomas
