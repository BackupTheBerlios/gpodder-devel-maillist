Nice :-) I'm at the moment typing with one hand (the other had a
surgery) so I cut'n'pasted some corners with the code ;-) 

&gt;<i> Just a small wish for possible future patches: Please use &quot;svn diff &gt;

Will do. Don't know subversion too much yet... :-)

Another feature I thought of would be that one could set an expiration
date. Maybe one can already do this? So that one can easily delete all
podcasts older than the limit you set in the current channel...

Keep up the excellent work

Preben
