<PRE>Hello Mike,

Sorry for being a bit slow to answer this one..

Thanks, I've added the check but in slightly different way that makes
sure we have a directory to sync to, etc..

</I>
For the &quot;Cleanup/Remove podcasts&quot; function, gPodder should always
delete all podcasts from the device (I've implemented this behaviour
in current SVN head).

For the synchronization feature: This feature should really check for
locally deleted podcasts (that's why it's called &quot;sync&quot; and not
&quot;copy&quot;). I've yet to do this, and I want to have it implemented in a
clean and maintainable way. Same thing for the iPod synchronization.

Maybe I've time to investigate some easy and fast way to do it this
weekend :)


Thanks,
Thomas
