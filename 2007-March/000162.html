</I>
If you're talking about simply marking an episode as played as soon as
you click on the &quot;Play&quot; button, this is no problem. But I suppose you
will want to mark it played only when the player application finished
playing the song? That'd be technically difficult.

Another option would be to mark the episode played as soon as you click
on the Play button but add the ability to mark episodes unplayed again
(like e-mail programs do for read/unread). Would this fulfill the need?

&gt;<i> 2. A way for my iPod to then update and reflect the &quot;played&quot; status of
</I>&gt;<i> the podcasts.
</I>
I think newer iPods have something that has been described to me as a
&quot;blue dot&quot;, but on my iPod mini, I can't see the played/unplayed status
of Podcasts. If you want such a feature, you'd have to test it on your
iPod and report back if it works or not, because I can't test here.

&gt;<i> 3. An option to only synchronize &quot;unplayed, the last 3 unplayed, etc&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> podcast. 
</I>
I suppose as soon as we're having better sync support (e.g. &quot;delete
podcasts from iPod that have been deleted from the computer&quot; and &quot;delete
podcasts already played on iPod from iPod and computer&quot;, etc..) we will
also have more configuration options for synchronization. For now, you
can always simply select the episodes you want to sync and click on the
&quot;Transfer&quot; button --- oh, wait.. that's just in the svn version. I'll
have a look if we can do a new release soon enough to push out the new
sync features to a broader audience in a stable release :)


Thanks,
Thomas
