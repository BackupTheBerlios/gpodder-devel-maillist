<PRE>Hello,

I have again a little very basic question regarding Gpodder file transfer.

As reported in bug 755 (<A HREF="https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755">https://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755</A>), 
some sources have podcast names which are not very well managed and when 
sent to a MP3 reader,  all get the same name and are replacing each 
other, finally only 1 file is saved.

With Gpodder &quot;send on folder&quot; feature, this doesn't happen and it's very 
fine as it is the one I use and need - I forward many podcasts from 
different subscriptions to a folder, rename them in mass with 
Metamorphose and copy them in my Samsung MP3 reader recognized as USB 
mount drive.

Just, with &quot;send to folder&quot; function, on the contrary to &quot;sent to MP3&quot;, 
forwarding and saving are not automatic, without validating and 
confirming files names.

To be more clear : when I select multiple episodes then &quot;send to 
folder&quot;, a Nautilus / GtkFileChooser window opens, allowing me to choose 
destination folder. Good.

But then, I have to click one by one for all files to save in order to 
validate their denomination. In my case, I always keep original name, 
without modification (as said I change it after with Metamorphose 
software by mass renaming or manually if necessary).

So when there are dozens of files, it's time and energy consuming to 
click a lot of on &quot;Save&quot;... I'd like to do it just once to choose target 
folder and hop... automatically and instantly Gpodder / Nautilus copies 
all the files in this folder with their origin name without asking each 
time.

What I have understood is that GtkFileChooser behavior depends on the 
program which launches it.

Very easy and basic thing, but would make daily use nicer. Perhaps it 
still exists and I did not find it, do you know if it is possible to add 
a configuration option for that ?

Thanks in advance. Best regards,

Xavier
