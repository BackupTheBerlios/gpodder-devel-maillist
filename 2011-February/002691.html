<PRE>Hi there!

tl;dr: New blog, QML UI, Android, Web UI, updates on &quot;tres&quot; branch

We're still alive and kicking, and so here are some general updates on
what has happened in gPodder development recently:

*) gpodder.net is slow - We know about it, and plan to utilize a second
   virtual server for some load balancing. Stefan is doing some great
   work there, and we are happy to see the web service being utilized :)

*) mail problems - I've not been getting mails for some days in
   February; this has since been fixed. I'll try to have faster
   turnaround times for gPodder-related mails again :)

*) blog.gpodder.org - In order to make it easier to communicate
   development news (libmygpo-qt 1.0 has been released, and the news
   item is still missing - will be fixed after this mail), there is now
   a Blogger-powered blog; expect more timely (and hopefully
   fine-grained) news updates in addition to the release announcements.

*) QML UI - A touch-optimized, experimental UI written in Qt and QML,
   utilizing PySide (Video: <A HREF="http://youtu.be/0b592zhepwQ">http://youtu.be/0b592zhepwQ</A>); this might be
   used as default UI on the Maemo 5 version of gPodder, and could also
   come in handy for future touch-based devices. One important feature
   of the QML UI is that playback is handled inside gPodder now, which
   makes resuming and playback position tracking much easier.

*) Android port - A few months ago, I tried out SL4A (basically Python
   for Android) and got the CLI running; this weekend, I played around
   with a HTML UI; so far, this seems to work nicely, and if anybody of
   you is interested in this and can help with the HTML UI, this could
   be a fully-fledged gPodder running on Android; using Python :) Using
   Python helps keeping the development effort small and will lead to a
   fully-fledged gPodder application on Android much faster than other
   &quot;native&quot; Java efforts that haven't worked out so well in the past.

*) Web UI - As the Android port's UI is basically a glorified Web UI,
   this means that a Web UI will probably find its way into a future
   version of gPodder. Using the Web UI, you can for example run gPodder
   headless on a media server and manage your podcasts and downloads via
   a web browser.

*) &quot;tres&quot; - This is the experimental branch of gPodder that I've been
   working on since mid-December 2010. This probably deserves a blog
   post of its own, and I've hinted at some cool features in earlier
   mails. Basically, the database and config get to live in the download
   folder (which makes backups a lot easier and gives us &quot;portable mode&quot;
   where all gPodder data is put directly on your MP3 player for free).
   This branch also removes lots of configuration options, it removes
   support for Maemo 4 (N8x0) and support for device synchronization.

Now, before you start throwing full wine bottles at your computer
screen: gPodder 2.x (the current &quot;master&quot; branch) will still see some
releases, as the &quot;tres&quot; branch isn't stable yet. When bugs are reported,
they will be fixed, and a release will be made periodically. The &quot;cool&quot;
new stuff happens in &quot;tres&quot;.

For some users, having the downloads and the DB in a single folder will
make syncing with devices unnecessary. For others, it is expected that
someone steps up and writes a little syncing GUI on top of gPodder. This
could either be in the form of hooks or via a standalone application,
utilizing gPodder's Python library. gPodder &quot;tres&quot; is much more modular
than the current codebase, and it exposes the database to the user as a
file. I plan to document the database schema so other applications can
read and modify the gPodder database if they want.

Having the gPodder database+config+downloads in a single folder also
allows us to work with a download folder (&quot;podcast repository&quot; if you
will) from multiple applications - e.g. the GTK+ app on your Desktop,
the CLI on your netbook and the QML UI on your media PC or N900.
Applications only need to implement reading the database (a simple
SQLite3 file), and they can access and display the podcast
subscriptions, and update the playback status inside the database.

Comments and feedback (as well as wishes), as always, very welcome :)


Thanks,
Thomas
