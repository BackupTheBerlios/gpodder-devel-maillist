</I>&gt;<i>   * Add a &quot;submit&quot; functionality to gPodder

This is an ambitious idea, I would be willing to contribute
descriptions of the podcasts to which I listen to such a directory if
this feature were implemented.

That being said, it seems like a bit of a task to create and maintain
what would end up being a rather large and sprawling collection.
Maintenance in particular would seem like a big problem to me -- what
happens when a podcast goes dead? What if it has explicit content? It
would require a bit of administrative effort, I should think.

Some of the problems could probably be solved by clever coding and
crowd-sourcing, but it still appears to be an enormous burden --
especially considering gpodder's enthusiastic yet modest user base.

Might it be better to find an existing directory and integrate their
content via something similar to the current OPML-based &quot;Import from
Web&quot;? From a cursory search, it looks like <A HREF="http://podcast.com">http://podcast.com</A> is a
fairly comprehensive directory and allows their lists to be exported
as OPML, such as this list of BBC Radio 4 programs:
<A HREF="http://opml.podcast.com/44343">http://opml.podcast.com/44343</A>

I don't know if podcast.com is the ideal solution (only bottom-level
directories actually link directly to podcast feeds, top-level general
categories link to sub-categories' OPML within podcast.com -- perhaps
gpodder integration would involve traversing these various levels of
categories), but it may be an option.

I hope I don't sound too dour or negative, I certainly agree that a
feature such as the one suggested would be a great addition to
gpodder. For me, it often falls to luck or word of mouth when it comes
to discovering a new podcast, so a user-friendly tool would likely go
a long way to help.

This should prove to be an interesting discussion, I hope this feature
finds support.

Thanks as always, Thomas.
