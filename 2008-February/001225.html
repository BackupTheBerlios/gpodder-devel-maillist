<PRE>Hello!

Once again, we did a great job this month making yet another great
gPodder release come true. We've reached our release goals for 0.11.0
and it is available for download from <A HREF="http://gpodder.org/">http://gpodder.org/</A> now.

Thanks to all who were involved in creating this release. I hope I
didn't forget anyone in the release notes. If I did, please send me a
short note.

Of course, gPodder development doesn't stop here. &#65279;J&#233;r&#244;me already did a
great job adding a progress bar to the tray icon, and there were some
other minor improvements that are available in SVN trunk but have not
made it into this release.

For the next month, we plan to finally support pause/resume downloads.
See the roadmap on <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/roadmap">http://wiki.gpodder.org/roadmap</A> for more information
about what's planned.


Enjoy!
Thomas

-- release notes follow --

As always before the end of the month, we present you yet another great
gPodder release: gPodder 0.11.0, featuring the long-awaited first
version of our tray icon support (and J&#233;r&#244;me is already working on some
improvements in SVN trunk). Apart from that, this release also adds an
improved, new synchronization module (which brings CLI support a'la
gpodder --sync), support for sending single episodes to your
Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices, a new, about:config-like expert
configuration editor and last but not least usability updates for the
main window. Of course, we have also fixed a bunch of bugs that were
reported in this release cycle via our bug tracker. Don't forget to look
at the new screenshots :)

You are encouraged to upgrade to this new version of gPodder. You will
find the source tarball and distribution packages on the downloads page.
Thanks to Nick (nikosapi.org) for donating a two-year domain
registration for gpodder.org. Also thanks to Paul Rudkin, who hosts
bugs.gpodder.org on his web server.

If you have any questions or problems, please see our FAQs, our Wiki or
the Mailing list. Enjoy!
