</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it does not follow the Gnome HIG. So my suggestion is to remove the icons

Your patch looks okay, I did a modified version of your patch and merged
it with my episode description patch I did some days ago (also posted
here on the mailing list).

The patch applies to a clean r556 checkout of our svn trunk (you might
want to do &quot;svn update &amp;&amp; svn revert -R .&quot; to get a clean working dir
state).

Here are the changes included in the patch:
 * &quot;View menu&quot;
    -&gt; &quot;show toolbar&quot; (ctrl+t) and &quot;show descriptions&quot; (ctrl+d)
 * Improved episode list columns (better space handling, etc..)
 * Removed resizable columns in episode list and description column
 * Add &quot;Ctrl+L&quot; as a shortcut for &quot;add channel&quot;
 * Move widgets around, like you suggested
 * Remove &quot;update feeds&quot; toolbar button and add new button in window

You can now dynamically switch the toolbar and the descriptions on and
off in the main window with &quot;Ctrl+T&quot; and &quot;Ctrl+D&quot;.

&gt;<i> I think the little icons look good, they help the user distinguish between 
</I>&gt;<i> between the various menus. Does the gnome HIG explicitly say not to include 
</I>&gt;<i> little icons? (sorry, I'm not very familiar with the guidelines)
</I>
I think the HIG already mentioned it somewhere and I read some usability
document about how the icons should only be placed on important menu
items and not on all items - that reverts the effect of icons in menus
being a visual hint or something like that.

I left it the way it is, because I liked the look and I think the icons
in the menubar (not in its submenu) are a good visual guide on where the
single menu items start and end. It's very clear that there are
(currently) four menus that can be popped up, it's not so clear with
text-only menu bars. But that's my opinion ;)

What do other people think about icons in the main menu? Should we think
about removing the icons on some items?

&gt;<i> From what I can see on [1] I don't think it would be much of an issue. In fact 
</I>&gt;<i> if we really were to comply with the gnome HIG, the &quot;Podcasts&quot; menu would 
</I>&gt;<i> have to be renamed to &quot;File&quot;, but once again I think &quot;Podcasts&quot; is a better 
</I>&gt;<i> choice.
</I>
Yes, I agree here. But on the other hand, when talking about the menu,
maybe we should rename &quot;Channel&quot; to &quot;Episodes&quot;, as the items in this
menu are all related to doing something with the currently selected
episodes.
