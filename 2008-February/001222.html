<PRE>Hello, &#65279;J&#233;r&#244;me!

Thanks, I've fixed that :)

Well, because of the alpha channel, I have to copy the icon every time I
draw a progressbar on it (or else I would modify the current pixmap and
after some time, the progress bar would have a solid background).

&gt;<i> * the tray icon is drawned on every ratio change, it happens very

</I>&gt;<i> that the icon is 48 pixels big, only 48 are idealy needed. At least,

</I>
I have updated the code so it only updates the progress bar when the
progress meter changes for more than 3 percent-points, so we save a lot
of updates and it doesn't get noticed in the tray icon (even at maximum
size). 100/3 ~ 30 pixels - given that we subtract some pixels for the
padding and the border, that will be about one pixel in full size.

I've also fixed a related problem where cancelling a download in a
two-download scenario would result in the cancelled download being
counted as finished in the complete progress.

Please test this patch and tell me what you think. If everything's okay,
I will commit it into SVN trunk.

Thanks,
Thomas
