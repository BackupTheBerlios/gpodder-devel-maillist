Hmm, I know there are some patches like yours (one person at least
always patches gPodder to have human-readable file names). Maybe we
should create a Wiki page (&quot;patches&quot;) with unofficial patches that are
kept current an can be applied to SVN trunk.

This is where I'd put your patch, too, because I think it's not suited
for the main distribution (i.e. people can be confused when their
channel list and &quot;add channel&quot; and &quot;update feeds&quot; widgets all
disappear).

&gt;<i> The .glade changes may suggest that there is lots of changes in the

Yes, that's something stupid about different glade versions producing
strange XML output. I've had this problem several times already, too.
I've been thinking about some tool that one can run after editing the
gladefile that makes sure the diff only contains the necessary changes.
It works with &quot;glade-2&quot; for me, most of the time. Hmm..
