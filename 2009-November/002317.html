<PRE>Hello!

Here are some random news about the current status of gPodder:

=== WIKI ==== === == -  -

I've taken the time to clean up and the gPodder Wiki yesterday, and
merged several mini-pages into the user manual. I also cleaned up
unnecessary or misleading sections in the user manual, and made the main
page more user-friendly (hopefully ;). Have a look at the User manual
Wiki page, and take the time to review it, adding missing sections and
removing misleading information:

  <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/User_Manual">http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/User_Manual</A>

=== WEBSITE = === == -  -

I have added a link to the Mac OS X port (by neric27) and Maemo 5 &quot;Maemo
Select&quot; page to the downloads page of the website. The &quot;help&quot; page now
has a section for &quot;URL shortcuts&quot; that you can use to link to commits,
wiki pages or bugs (I tend to find it easier to type gpodder.org/bug/123
than to type the long Bugzilla &quot;show_bug&quot; URL):

  <A HREF="http://gpodder.org/documentation.html">http://gpodder.org/documentation.html</A>

=== MYGPO === === == -  -

The development of the new version of my.gpodder.org is in full swing,
and we are planning to deploy a first version this weekend. If you are a
developer and want to integrate the my.gpodder.org service into your own
application, please give feedback on the API draft:

  <A HREF="http://gpodder.org/wiki/Web_Services/API">http://gpodder.org/wiki/Web_Services/API</A>

The source code of the webservice will always be pushed to a public Git
repository whenever the code is deployed to the web server, so you can
have a look at the code, deploy it on your own web server, or send patches.

=== RELEASE = === == -  -

The last release (2.0) has been in mid-September, and there have been
several bug reports about things that were already fixed in the
development version. so it's time to do another release soon. I have
made myself a private list of things I want to include in the new
release, and (depending on my free time) we should have a new gPodder
release out in the upcoming days or weeks.


Thanks,
Thomas
