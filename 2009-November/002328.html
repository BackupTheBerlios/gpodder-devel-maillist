I guess it depends on the features of the tagging libraries. AFAIK
mutagen is quite good at handling lots of different file types. We could
add an additional command line utility (&quot;gpodder-update-tags&quot;?) that is
licensed under the GPLv2 and uses mutagen. gPodder can then check at
runtime if this utility is available and call it (again, passing the
values via environment variables or some other means).

I think this modular approach has its advantages, as we don't have to
ship (and load!) every extension by default, but only use what we need.

Or you could even write a D-Bus service that can update tags, and let
gPodder utilize that :) Be aware this would lock out Windows users, as
D-Bus is not supported in gPodder for Windows.

(Or we wait until Tracker's writeback[1] support gets into distros, and
just use that ;)

HTH.

Thomas
