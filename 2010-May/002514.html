Talking from a very high-level perspective, it's an issue with Apple not
allowing third-party applications to talk to their devices. All that the
community knows about the iTunesDB has been reverse-engineered.

I personally don't have an iPod touch, so I can't help you with it. I'm
always open for patches improving support for these devices, but it's a
very unsatisfying job to get things working with such a closed system.

What you can try, however, is to play with the code in
set_podcast_flags() in src/gpodder/sync.py, which contains the code to
set the playcount, some flags (again, as it has been reverse engineered,
the flags are called &quot;flag1&quot;, &quot;flag2&quot; and &quot;flag3&quot;, and the values have
been determined by looking at podcasts synced to iPods from iTunes).

It might also help if you could provide us with the values for the flags
mentioned in set_podcast_flags() before and after playing them on the
iPod touch, maybe this way we can find out a way to set the values
correctly for the iPod touch.

If you want to help fixing this, please get in touch, and I'll provide
you with information on what to try out and which values to determine,
and we should be able to figure something out and maybe come up with a
working solution for iPod touch users.

What you can try out right now is to comment out all calls to
&quot;set_podcast_flags()&quot; in src/gpodder/sync.py and synchronize, which
should make the synchronized files appear as normal songs on the iPod.

HTH.
Thomas
