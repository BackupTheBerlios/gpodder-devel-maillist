<PRE>Hello!

Please try to split your text into paragraphs and format lists so that
they really look like lists and are easier to read. It was quite
difficult to read that mail :/

</I>
Yes, this is possible from the command line now and does the same thing
that the GUI does, in terms of syncing. No need to implement a special
script to do that anymore.

&gt;<i> 2.) Is the new sync code in place enough, either in 0.11.2 or
</I>&gt;<i> subversion, to where I could begin working on converting/adding SQLite
</I>&gt;<i> support?
</I>
As you can see from <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/roadmap">http://wiki.gpodder.org/roadmap</A> and from the release
announcements, this feature is in place since 0.11.0.

All patches should be against current SVN trunk, and you should follow
the instructions on <A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/running-from-svn">http://wiki.gpodder.org/running-from-svn</A> to find out
how you should submit a patch to the bug tracker so that it can easily
be merged. Be prepared to go through some iterations of re-fining and
fixing up your patch before it can be accepted.

&gt;<i> 3.) Can I a get a link, or @least a reminder as to what coding
</I>&gt;<i> standard gPodder uses, PYN-9, or what was it?
</I>
We try to follow PEP-8 for all new contributions, even though old parts
of the code don't follow that guideline. For all new patches, these
guidelines should be followed.

PEP-8: <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</A>

&gt;<i> But when I try to run `gpodder --run` from the cli gPodder dies with
</I>&gt;<i> the following error:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 Traceback (most recent call last):
</I>&gt;<i>                   File &quot;/usr/bin/gpodder&quot;, line 166, in &lt;module&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>                   File

</I>&gt;<i>                 NameError: name 'default_bittorrent_dir' is not

</I>
You probably mixed different versions of gPodder on your system. Please
remove all packages, all self-installed versions and then keep looking
for leftovers from previous installs in /usr and /usr/local. Then, get
the SVN version and try to run it - it should work.

&gt;<i> My final question, For any bug fixes that I fix, sqlite conversion,
</I>&gt;<i> playlist manager, &amp;using python-xine to enable media playing right
</I>&gt;<i> inside gPodder(w/support for all the beautiful codecs,
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;*cough-ick-gah*).
</I>
That wasn't really a question, was it? Any ideas should be filed in the
bug tracker before starting working on it, so no duplicate work is done
(if there already is a bug report for that specific idea/problem, DON'T
open a new bug report, but add a comment to the old bug). Please also
submit bugs to the same bug ID that you originally filed the bug
against.

Because you mentioned python-xine: If you really want to start working
on a feature like this, please use gstreamer instead of xine for
portability reasons. If you don't do that, chances might be that we
can't accept your patch, because it won't work on all supported
platforms.

Thanks,
Thomas
