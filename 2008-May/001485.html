In such cases it's also worth considering cleaning up the library and
getting rid of music you don't listen to anyway. I did this for my iPod
with 6GB of space (removing all songs and then cherry-picking the songs
I want to have with me on the go). The positive result is that when I'm
now in shuffle mode, I only get to hear songs that I really like
(mostly).

This is true for the library of songs that are &gt; 1 year old. Of course,
I have lots of recent music on it to try, but someday in the future,
I'll get rid of all the &quot;new&quot; songs that didn't work out to be in my
list of favorites.

I'd probably go for a very small size (at least physical) player in case
my iPod mini broke.
