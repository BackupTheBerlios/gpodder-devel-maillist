The patch looks good, and I like the code unification/cleanups you have
done :) Really great work! I've posted your file and mail text to the
bug report at <A HREF="http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56,">http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56,</A> as this is
probably a good place to post/review and discuss patches.

I'll review and post a followup for this bug report soon (on the bug
page), you might want to subscribe to that bug, so you get bug mail for
it :)


Thanks,
Thomas
