Thanks. As this is quite a small patch and isn't as intrusive as the
other one, I've fixed it up a bit and am attaching it to this mail for
you to have a look at. You might want to open a bug report and attach
the patch there, so we can have the discussion about the patch and
possible changes in there.

I've also added support for iPods :)

Yes, that would be very helpful, possibly also offering the user to
delete old episodes from the device (I imagine a simply
show_confirmation asking the user to delete episodes before syncing
should do the trick). It should not be too hard to implement, simply
move the code for calculating the sync size to podcastChannel in
libpodcasts, the code for calculating the free disk space is already in
the gpodder.sync module. Then, the check can be a simple
&quot;channel.get_sync_size() &lt;= device.get_free_diskspace()&quot; or so.

&gt;<i> New function sync_stats return true or false depending on whether
</I>&gt;<i> there's enough space on device to sync all suitable episodes. 
</I>
Maybe we should change the naming of these functions. It's not really
&quot;sync stats&quot; but &quot;sync free diskspace check&quot; or something like that.
Maybe &quot;sync disk usage&quot; would be nice, and we should be able to
determine the used disk space for a device, because we can get the files
and their sizes and calculate the used disk space there.

Looking forward to your improved patch, it looks really promising!


Thanks,
Thomas
