<PRE>Hi all,

I have been using gpodder for quite some time now. I have an old iPod 3rd generation, on which I usually use Rockbox. In this way, in gpodder I can sync the episodes to the device as if it is a mass storage device.

Since my iPod is coming of age, I am considering a new one, and I thought it would be good to test if gpodder can sync with iPods. So I have started my iPod on the normal iPod software, and I installed libgpod on my (gentoo linux) computer.

When I click in &quot;Additional Components&quot;, it says that ipod synchronization if possible. But when I click on &quot;sync episodes to device&quot;, I get a strange popup that says &quot;Error... (newline) check...&quot;. But in the terminal there is no output! 

I have tried to sync a song to my iPod with rhythmbox - this works fine. But gpodder refuses. Any clues? When I start gpodder, it used to say that libgpod was not present, and syncing to iPod was disabled. Right now there is no such message - just a strange message of some error, no info in the terminal, and no sync to the device....

Please help! I don't want to change gpodder for something else :-))

Wilfred
