<PRE>
I've been using gPodder for a good few weeks and really like it. I have a couple of questions that I've not been able to find an answer in the manual, wiki, FAQ, or bugs list.

1. Is there any way to completely remove old podcasts from the episode list. I know you can 'delete' an episode by right-clicking, which displays the trashcan icon next to that podcast. However, I haven't been able to figure out how then to purge or completely remove that podcast from the episode list. From the FAQ, it seems that I should be able to do something like this:

<A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/FAQs#How_can_I_delete_played.2Fold_episodes_from_my_iPod.2FMP3_player.3F">http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/FAQs#How_can_I_delete_played.2Fold_episodes_from_my_iPod.2FMP3_player.3F</A>

I know that there are 'autodelete' options but I would rather clear old episodes myself rather than wait for a certain number of days after listening to the episode.

2. From the manual:

<A HREF="http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/User_Manual#Changing_Title_and_description">http://wiki.gpodder.org/wiki/User_Manual#Changing_Title_and_description</A>

It seems that I can't edit the episode title or description. Does this refer to the ID3 tag on the mp3, or something within gPodder itself? I generally edit the ID3 tag on the podcasts so I more can easily identify which episode I'm listening to while driving (my car stereo only shows the first few characters in the episode title). Is this something that is possible with gPodder, or does that manual entry mean that you've made a choice to keep it out of scope? I can of course always use EasyTag or something similiar, but was just wondering.

thanks! 

Joseph
